Accidentally found interesting way to modify `rofi`. Now, I just need themes. 
Before I change my cursor, i need to know how to make a pkgbuild file. That way `pacman` will know how to track the changes in my system. I'll make a pkgbuild for koishi cursor. I remember dowloading that somewhere but I forgot where.
I use `acpilight` because `xbacklight` does not work. Instructions go [here](https://gitlab.com/wavexx/acpilight). Let me postpone this, I need to prioritize making a PKGBUILD.
