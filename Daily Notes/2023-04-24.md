**memory management in early systems**
- most single-user memory managers tries to allocate all the memory required by a user process
- allocates a contiguous piece of memory to the single-user process
	- whole memory / not divided
 problems:
 - most of the time, single processors does not fully occupy the alloted memory for user process
 - creates an unused portion of the memory
 - some users process try to access (worse modify) accidentally or intentionally, area occupied by the OS
	 - memory area is not protected yet (in the early days)
	- still has no protection schemes

**single-user systems**
- sizes of the program are limited to the amount of main storage reserved for the user process
- if memory requirement of a user process is greater than the available memory, then it cannot be executed anymore
- solved by **overlays**
	- when a section of the program is not needed anymore, another section maybe brought in from secondary storage to occupy the storage used to be occupied by the section no needed for execution anymore
	- allows programmers to extend the limited main storage for user process
	- controlled by programmers; requires careful planning

**multiprogramming system**
- ...
- for batched systems, the idea is to:
	- load fixed number of tasks in memory
	- divide memory into small-size, medium-size, and large-size partitions
(get image on page 21 of the ppt)
- each paritioni is associated wih a queue
- each partition  could hold one job and CPU is switced rapidly between jobs in the partition to create the illusion of parallelism
- partitions are set up by the operator in the morning until the next day, or until the operator decides to change sizes during the day
- requires reconfiguration of the system
- idea: when a job arrives it can be placed into a queue for the smallest partition large enough to hold it
- best-fit algorithm:
	- place a job in parition that will minimize the amount of memory unused
	- since partitions are fixed, any unoccupied space is lost
	- internal fragmentation which is a loss since the space memory is unused
