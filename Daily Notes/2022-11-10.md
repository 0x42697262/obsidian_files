variables are characterized by types
- name
- address
	- may have different addresses at different times during execution
		- might be related to why cheat engine base pointers are a pain to acquire
	- may have different addresses at different places in a program
	- aliases (at least two names) can access the same address
		- bad because they are hard to understand, difficult to analyze, and optimize.
- type
	- range of the variable (possible values allowed?)
- value
	- left-value: address
	- right-value: value (lol)
- abstract memory cell
	- program variables are just abstraction of computer memory cells?
types must consider scope, lifetime, type checking, initialization, and type compability. knew about lifetimes in rust but not much.
