CMSC 124 Machine Problem 1  
Topic Coverage: Background and Preliminaries


# 1. Choose 4 programming languages (hereafter referred to as PL) that you are comfortable  working with.

# 2. Create a simple program that will ask for a temperature in Fahrenheit and will output its equivalent value in Celsius

**1st Language**: Python

**2nd Language** C++

**3rd Language**: Rust

**4th Langauge**: Java

# 3. Write a small program in your chosen PL that can store student information, such as the  following: Name, Age, GPA (float), Grade Level (“Freshman”, “Sophomore”, “Junior”,  “Senior”)
**1st Language:** Python

**3rd Language**: Rust

**4th Language**: Java

# 4. Now, evaluate each PL according to the different language evaluation criteria discussed in  class.

# 5. Determine the paradigm(s) of your chosen PL. Remember that there is no particular paradigm suited to a specific PL, so list down all applicable paradigm.

# 6. Describe the method of implementation for every PL you have chosen. Explain in detail what happens to your source code upon compilation, down to execution.
