| Python | Simplicity - <br /> Dynamically Typed so there is no need to declare anything. Uses indention and is compact when reading. Syntaxes are almost similar to English language. Python has the right simplicity for reading and understanding. Operator overloading is intuitive enough like adding integers, concatenating stirngs, and merging two lists. Although it mostly has no feature multiciplity. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> Python has high orthogonality since all of its keywords are reserved, has a full consistent rules, and a very predictable interaction making it easy to learn and undersand, and of course read.<br /> Control Statements -  <br /> Python has a sequential control statement that executes from top to bottom. It also has simple branching flow from the conditional statements. Repetition of code is simple enough due to its syntax form of the looping statements. <br /> Data Types and Structures - <br /> Supports almost every kind of data types and it does not need to be explicitly defined since Python is interpreted, not compiled but you can annotate the data types for readability.  <br /> Syntax Designs - <br /> Python is written with indention rather than curly braces and compact enough to be read. | Simplicity - <br /> Python has lower learning overhead thus it is easier to write, and also has fewer lines of code making it much simplier to understand but not to the point it's confusing. Writing I/O is easier as it mostly has support for input and full support for output. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> It has very high orthogonality to the point that a programmer does not expect its behavior if not well-trained enough in Python. This makes Python very flexible to write. <br /> Expressivity - <br /> Python has relatively high convenience when it comes to expressing its syntaxes due to its simple design. It is capable of writing a cleaner one-liner code instead of multi-line codes. | Type Checking - <br /> Python is Dynamically Typed thus it is unreliable on this criteria since data types can change based on the values assigned, and that value may contain an error. <br /> Exception Handling - <br /> Python has a complete exception handling. <br /> Aliasing - <br /> Python automatically aliases variables when assigned to another variable instead of copying new values. For the untrained, this often leads to confusion and lower reliability. Python has uncontrolled aliasing making it unreliable. |
| C++    | Simplicity - <br /> C++ is complex as it supports full feature multiciplity. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> Has low orthogonality due to arithmetic do not consistently work on pointers. <br /> Control Statements - <br /> Has good control statements that improves readability. <br /> Data Types and Structures - <br /> Strongly Typed making it easier to read. <br /> Syntax Designs - <br /> All keywords are reserved, does not have consistent rules, and no predictable interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Simplicity - <br /> Supports Operator Overloading increasing its writability. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> C++ also has loose type checking. <br /> Expressivity - It has multiple ways to expess syntaxes like incrementing and decrementing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Type Checking - <br /> C++ is statically typed making it reliable. <br /> Exception Handling - <br /> Supports most exception handling for increased reliability. <br /> Aliasing - <br /> C++ has controlled making it secure and reliable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

# 5. Determine the paradigm(s) of your chosen PL. Remember that there is no particular paradigm suited to a specific PL, so list down all applicable paradigm.

# 6. Describe the method of implementation for every PL you have chosen. Explain in detail what happens to your source code upon compilation, down to execution.
