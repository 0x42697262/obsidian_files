| Python | Simplicity - <br /> Dynamically Typed so there is no need to declare anything. Uses indention and is compact when reading. Syntaxes are almost similar to English language. Python has the right simplicity for reading and understanding. Operator overloading is intuitive enough like adding integers, concatenating stirngs, and merging two lists. Although it mostly has no feature multiciplity. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> Python has high orthogonality since all of its keywords are reserved, has a full consistent rules, and a very predictable interaction making it easy to learn and undersand, and of course read.<br /> Control Statements -  <br /> Python has a sequential control statement that executes from top to bottom. It also has simple branching flow from the conditional statements. Repetition of code is simple enough due to its syntax form of the looping statements. <br /> Data Types and Structures - <br /> Supports almost every kind of data types and it does not need to be explicitly defined since Python is interpreted, not compiled but you can annotate the data types for readability.  <br /> Syntax Designs - <br /> Python is written with indention rather than curly braces and compact enough to be read. | Simplicity - <br /> Python has lower learning overhead thus it is easier to write, and also has fewer lines of code making it much simplier to understand but not to the point it's confusing. Writing I/O is easier as it mostly has support for input and full support for output. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> It has very high orthogonality to the point that a programmer does not expect its behavior if not well-trained enough in Python. This makes Python very flexible to write. <br /> Expressivity - <br /> Python has relatively high convenience when it comes to expressing its syntaxes due to its simple design. It is capable of writing a cleaner one-liner code instead of multi-line codes. | Type Checking - <br /> Python is Dynamically Typed thus it is unreliable on this criteria since data types can change based on the values assigned, and that value may contain an error. <br /> Exception Handling - <br /> Python has a complete exception handling. <br /> Aliasing - <br /> Python automatically aliases variables when assigned to another variable instead of copying new values. For the untrained, this often leads to confusion and lower reliability. Python has uncontrolled aliasing making it unreliable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| C++    | Simplicity - <br /> C++ is complex as it supports full feature multiciplity. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> Has low orthogonality due to arithmetic do not consistently work on pointers. <br /> Control Statements - <br /> Has good control statements that improves readability. <br /> Data Types and Structures - <br /> Strongly Typed making it easier to read. <br /> Syntax Designs - <br /> All keywords are reserved, does not have consistent rules, and no predictable interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Simplicity - <br /> Supports Operator Overloading increasing its writability. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> C++ also has loose type checking. <br /> Expressivity - It has multiple ways to expess syntaxes like incrementing and decrementing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Type Checking - <br /> C++ is statically typed making it reliable. <br /> Exception Handling - <br /> Supports most exception handling for increased reliability. <br /> Aliasing - <br /> C++ has controlled making it secure and reliable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Rust   | Simplicity - <br /> Rust is not simple to read since there are a lot  to understand. It is also possible to overload operators through traits. <br /> Orthogonality - <br /> Rust is orthogonal, almost entirely orthogonal since keywords can be combined in different ways. <br /> Control Statements - <br /> Simple control statements that can be controlled by scopes. <br /> Data Types and Structures - <br /> Rust is Statically Typed and Strongly Typed, and supports a lot of data types increasing its readability. <br /> Syntax Designs - <br /> Rusts divides keywords into three tpes: strict, reserved, and weak. Further decreasing its readability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Simplicity - <br /> Rust is very hard to write as it has a lot of constructs to learn. <br /> Orthogonality -  <br /> Rust is capable of combining constructs. <br /> Expressivity - Rust has quite bothersome expressivity thus it is quite hard to write.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Type Checking - <br /> Rust is Statically and Strongly Typed so it is very strict in assigning or manipulating data types making it highly reliable <br /> Exception Handling - <br /> It does not have exceptions however Rust has its own way of handling errors and exceptions. Errors are not handled as error but rather as a result. There are no NULL values in Rust. Thus, you can expect Rust to be very reliable. <br /> Aliasing - <br /> Rust follows lifetimes and borrows when you assign a variable to another variable. Instead of copying them as reference to another variable, Rust handles it by moving the ownership of the value to another variable making it only have one way to manipulate the value. This way, it makes Rust very reliable. |

| Structured      | Structured      |   Trait-Oriented              | Structured      | 

# 6. Describe the method of implementation for every PL you have chosen. Explain in detail what happens to your source code upon compilation, down to execution.
**Python**
It is an interpreted language that is executed from top to bottom by the Python Interpreter. It first imports a library module `sqlite` needed to store our data. It has a class that handles the APIs for the storing of students to the library. When initiated, it first creates a database and executes a sql command to create a new table if it doesn't exists. The class has 3 main functions and 1 that simply handles commiting the data to the database. Those three functions are used for inserting, deleting, and querying. Aside from the class, there are two functions, the main and a console output function. The latter just prints text while the main function handles the user inputs and flow of the code. Before the code is ran, it checks if the code is imported or directly ran, if it's the latter then it proceeds to call the main function.

**C++**
C++ is a compiled language. The flow of execution of this code is similar to the Python code I have except this time the database connection has to be closed manually which can be found at the end of the main function. The student information this time however are strongly-typed unlike in Python. The callback function is used for printing the queried statement of the database.

**Rust**
Rust is similar to C++ which is a compiled language. Although this time it does not contain a class but instead a struct just like in C language. It first imports a crate `rusqlite` for sqlite. A struct is then created to store the students information. Then two sub-functions exists for printing texts or console outputs and a function for handling inputs. The main function is the base flow of the code, it creates a new database connection and then executes a sql command to check if a table does not exist then create it if it doesn't. The student struct is then created as a mutable (mutable in a way that we can modify the values later on). The control structure is then ran on a while loop checking for inputs from the user to either store a new student, delete a student, or exit the program. 

**Java**
Since Java is a simple language, you should have already understood the code. It is an interpreted language however it is compiled to a byte-code specifically for Java. The code execution is quite similar to the Rust code I have however with a slight difference of putting the entire code structure inside a main class `SIS`. This code however has extra dependency for connecting to a sqlite database, that is `sqlite-jdbc` which is a driver to read and write into a sqlite database file. This code first prepares sql statements unlike the other three source codes I have, making them easier to read.
