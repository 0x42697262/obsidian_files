# 1. Synthesize the lesson on software process models.
## Waterfall Model
### a. Types or kinds of software projects applicable  
- Short projects
- No vague requirements and a well known or understood requirements
- Well understood technology
### b. Advantages  
- Simple, easy to understand, use, and manage
- Activities are processed and completed one at a time
- Rigid structure
- Good for smaller projects with clearly defined requirements
### c. Disadvantages  
- High risk 
- Poor model for large and ongoing projects
- Not designed for complex and object-oriented projects
- No working software is produced until the last phase
- Inflexible, not suitable for changing requirements
### d. Mode of project delivery (processes, outputs)  
- Linear Process -> Complete Deployment
### e. Unique Characteristics (what differs the model from the others)
- Complete understanding of the requirements

## V-Model Model
### a. Types or kinds of software projects applicable  
- Only applicable to software projects that customers have high confidence in
### b. Advantages  
- Highly disciplined, easy to understand, and makes project management easier
- Good choice for software where downtimes and failures are unacceptable
- Problems are found at early stage
- Good for smaller projects with clearly defined requirements
- Has testing phase for every development phase
### c. Disadvantages  
- Not good for complex project or projects that have unclear or changing requirements
- Least flexible
- Test documents needs to be updated when there are changes in the development phase
### d. Mode of project delivery (processes, outputs)  
- Linear Process -> Complete Deployment
### e. Unique Characteristics (what differs the model from the others)
- For every phase in the development cycle, there is an associated testing phase

## Incremental Process Model
### a. Types or kinds of software projects applicable  
- 
### b. Advantages  
### c. Disadvantages  
### d. Mode of project delivery (processes, outputs)  
### e. Unique Characteristics (what differs the model from the others)

## Prototyping
### a. Types or kinds of software projects applicable  
### b. Advantages  
### c. Disadvantages  
### d. Mode of project delivery (processes, outputs)  
### e. Unique Characteristics (what differs the model from the others)

## Spiral Model
### a. Types or kinds of software projects applicable  
### b. Advantages  
### c. Disadvantages  
### d. Mode of project delivery (processes, outputs)  
### e. Unique Characteristics (what differs the model from the others)
