Activity Proper: Write a 1-page reaction paper of the two poems. Aside from the the basics of reading poetry that you have read and practiced, consider the guide questions below before drafting your paper (remember they are guide questions and they need not to be answered in the following order):

1.) Which stylistic tendency do the poems follow? Are they examples of romantic tendency of poetry or are they didactic?


("Hikalimtan" by Vicente Ranudo)

2.) The speaker is a suitor whose love is not reciprocated. What is his main argument to convince the woman that her acceptance is inevitable? Is the speaker's argument well-ordered?

3.) Read the poem aloud and listen carefully to the piece. Is it sincere or ironic? Are there any contradictions? Does the poem honor the woman or does it belittle the woman's intelligence? 

("Yamog" by Fernando Buyser)

4.) The structure of the poem is an example of the sonanoy, a verse form based on the sonnet. The story in the sonnet is often implicit and the situation's foundation is in a form of a poetic argument (supplementary reading--search: "My Mistress' Eyes.." and "Shall I compare thee..." by William Shakespeare) and the tension revolves around how the argument would be resolved. What is the tension of Fernando Buyser's Yamog?

5.) How is the argument resolved? What is the connection between the yamog (dew) and the bituon (star)?
