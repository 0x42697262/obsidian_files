**Common Q&A**  
**Q:** Do I need to make an implementation of the grammar I have defined for both problems posted?  
**A:** Yes, definitely! Since this is a Machine Problem, you are expected to make an implementation of the BNF grammars you have defined for both problems.

**Q:** Where do I indicate my BNF grammar definitions?  
**A:** You may kindly indicate your complete grammar definition in your source code, indicated as a comment. You may also indicate it in your submitted PDF file. But please, I would appreciate it more if you will indicate it in your source code, to facilitate easier checking on my part.

**Q:** What programming language can I use for this MP?  
**A:** You may use ANY language that you are comfortable with. Kindly make sure that your source code has no errors, and can run seamlessly when I execute it.

**Q:** What should be in my pdf submission?  
**A:** Kindly indicate the source code of both problem 1 and 2. You may also indicate your BNF grammar for both problems. But again, I would appreciate it if you can indicate it in your source code as a comment.
