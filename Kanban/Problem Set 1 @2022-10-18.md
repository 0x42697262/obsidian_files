Solve the following problems. And compute for the T(n) of your solutions.

    int reverse(int n) - returns the reverse of n. e.g. n = 103, return 301; n = 1496, return 6941. The use of any auxiliary function from some library is not allowed. The use of a string is also not allowed.

    void reverse(char st[]) - reverses the string st. e.g. st = "dragrace", reversed st = "ecargard"; st = "nodevillivedon", reversed st = "nodevillivedon".

    bool sorted(int A[], int n) - returns true if the array A with size n is sorted in increasing fashion or in decreasing fashion. It returns false otherwise. e.g. A = {10, 8, 7, 7, 2}, return true; A = {1, 17, 19, 43, 53, 53}, return true; A = {3, 23, 10, 17, 15}, return false; A = {4, 4, 4, 4, 4}, return false.

    int remainder(int a, int b) - returns the remainder when a is divided by b without using the modulo, times, and divide operators. Use of any other function from some library is not allowed as well. Implement this RECURSIVELY.
