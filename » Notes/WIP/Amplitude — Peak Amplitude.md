# Peak Amplitude

---

The peak [[Amplitude|amplitude]] of a signal is the absolute value of its highest intensity, proportional to the energy it carries. For electric signals, peak amplitude is normally measured in [[Voltage|volts]].

This figure shows two signals and their peak amplitudes. This discrepancy is due to the fact that these are [[Root Mean Square|root mean square (rms)]] values. The signal is squared and then the average amplitude is calculated. The peak value is equal to $2^{112}$xrms value.
