# Point-to-Point Network Topology

---

- It should be similar to [[Line Topology]] as point-to-point is simply [[Line Topology]] with only two nodes

```
Imagine you have two computers, let's call them Computer A and Computer B. In a point-to-point topology, you connect Computer A directly to Computer B with a single communication link, like a cable. It's like having a direct phone line between two people.
```

Point-to-point topology is a direct communication path between two endpoints, typically devices or nodes. There can only exist two devices connected to each other as Point-to-point topology is a direct communication link between the two.
