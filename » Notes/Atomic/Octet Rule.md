## What is an Octet Rule?

Octet Rule is when an [[Atom|atom]] will be most stable when surrounded with 8 [[Electron|electrons]] in the [[Valence Shell|valence shell]][^1]. [[Hydrogen]] is an [[Hydrogen#Exemption in Octet Rule|exemption]].

>[!NOTE]
>Octet Rule is not an absolute rule, there are exceptions. Some elements can have more than 8 electrons.

## How does Octet Rule works?

Can be achieved through [[Covalent Bond]] and [[Ionic Bond]].

- a [[Electron Configuration|configuration]] that has 8 [[Valence Electron|valence electrons]]  is called a [[Noble Gas Configuration|noble gas configuration]]
