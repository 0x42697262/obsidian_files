A systematic method of encrypting and decrypting messages or data.
It is used in [[Computer Security]] by protecting [[Data Communications]] and [[Computer Networking]].

Fully integrates [[CIA Triad]], that must be achieved at all cost:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

Cryptography is not limited to encrypting messages where [[Plain Text]] is converted into [[Cipher Text]], but instead a broader concept that involves other processes necessary for securing messages such as [[Encryption]], [[Hashing]], and [[Authentication]].

# History

## Paper Era

A "pen and ink" period.
[[Code]]s in this era is relatively simple because messages had to be decoded by hand.
Not very secure compared to modern standards.

Because of common cipher types [[Substitution Cipher]] and [[Transposition Cipher]].

## Mechanical Era

- [[Enigma machine]]

## Modern Era

Heavy reliance on mathematics and electronic computers.

- [[One-Time Pad]]
- [[Data Encryption Standard]] by [[National Institute for Standards in Technology]]
