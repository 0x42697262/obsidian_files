# Cryptography

---

It is used in [[Computer Security]] by protecting [[Data Communications]] and [[Computer Networking]].
Implemented through [[Encryption]] with a **key** that acts as a secret value to secure messages.

Fully integrates [[CIA Triad]], that must be achieved at all cost:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

## Types

- [[Symmetric Key Cryptography]]
- [[Asymmetric Key Cryptography]]
- [[Hash Function]]

## History

### Paper Era

A "pen and ink" period.
[[Code]]s in this era is relatively simple because messages had to be decoded by hand.
Not very secure compared to modern standards.

Because of [[Substitution Cipher]],  [[Caesar Cipher]] is well known.

### Mechanical Era

- [[Enigma machine]]

### Modern Era

Heavy reliance on mathematics and electronic computers.

- [[One-Time Pad]]
- [[Data Encryption Standard]] by [[National Institute for Standards in Technology]]
