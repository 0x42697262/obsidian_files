# Phase

---

The term phase describes the position of the waveform relative to time 0. If we think of the waves as something that can be shifted backward or forward along the time axis, phase describes the amount of that shift.

Phase is measured in degrees or radians.

- $360\degree$ $2n$ rad
- $1\degree$ is $\frac{2\pi}{360\degree}$ rad
- $1$ rad is $\frac{360}{2n}\degree$

**Phase Shifts**:

- a phase shift of $360\degree$ corresponds to a shift of a complete period
- a phase shift of $180\degree$ corresponds to a shift of one-half of a period
- a phase shift of $90\degree$ corresponds to a shift of one-quarter of a period

A sine wave is offset $\frac{1}{6}$ cycle with respect to time 0. What is its phase in degrees and radians

> [!NOTE]- Example 1 Answer
> We know that 1 complete cycle is $360\degree$. Therefore, $\frac{1}{6}$ cycle is $(\frac{1}{6}\times360\degree)\times\frac{2\pi}{360}=\frac{\pi}{3}=1.047197551$ rad
