# Sine Waves

---

Also known as **_sinusoidal wave_**.

The sine wave is the most fundamental form of a [[Periodic Analog Signals|periodic analog signal]]. When we visualize it as a simple oscillating curve, its change over the course of a cycle is smooth and consistent, a continuous, rolling flow. Each cycle consists of a single arc above the time axis followed by a single arc below it.

A sine wave can be represented by three parameters: the [[Amplitude â€” Peak Amplitude|peak amplitude]], the [[Period and Frequency|frequency]], and the [[Phases (Waves)|phase]]. These three parameters fully describe a sine wave.

The peak amplitude of a signal is the absolute value of its highest intensity, proportional to the energy it carries. For electric signals, peak amplitude is normally measured in volts.

### Applications of Simple Sine Waves

- power company sends a single sine wave with a frequency of 60 Hz to distribute electric energy to houses and businesses (sine wave carrying energy)
- send an alarm to a security center when a burglar opens a door or window in the house (sine wave is a signal of danger)

_In data communication, if we had only one single sine wave to convey a conversation over the phone, it would make no sense and carry no information; just hear a buzz._ A single-frequency sine wave is not useful in data communications; we need to send a [[Composite Signal|composite signal]], a signal made of many simple sine waves.
