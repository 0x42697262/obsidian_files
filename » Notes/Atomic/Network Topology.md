# Network Topology

---

Network Topology is the geometric representation of the relationship of all links and linking devices (nodes) to one another.

**Categories**:

1. `Physical Topology`: refers to the actual physical connections of how the network is arranged
2. `Logical Topology`: refers to the higher-level idea of how the network is arranged

**Types**:

1. [[Mesh Network Topology|Mesh Topology]] (Basic)
2. [[Star Network Topology|Star Topology]] (Basic)
3. [[Bus Network Topology|Bus Topology]] (Basic)
4. [[Ring network topology|Ring Topology]] (Basic)
5. [[Line Topology|Line Topology]]
6. [[Point-to-Point Network Topology|Point-to-Point Topology]]
7. [[Tree Network Topology|Tree Topology]]
8. [[Hybrid Network Topology|Hybrid Topology]]
