# Stellar [[Nucleosynthesis]]

---

The [[Nucleosynthesis|creation]] of [[chemical elements]] by [[Nuclear Fusion|nuclear fusion]] reactions within stars.

- the process in which heavier elements are formed through the [[Nuclear Fusion|nuclear fusion]] reaction in star's cores (from [[Helium]] to [[Iron]])
	- stellar [[Nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]] stops at iron because there is not enough [[Neutron|neutrons]] in their nuclei

## Process

**Requirements**:

1. [[Stellar Population]]:  [[Population I Stars]] and [[Population II Stars]] (produces [[Element|elements]] from [[Helium]] to [[Iron]])
2. Temperature
3. Pressure
4. Mass
