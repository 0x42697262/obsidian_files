# [[Data Integrity|Integrity]]

A property that prevents entities from tampering with our private data.
Maintenance of, and assurance of, accuracy and consistency (completeness and trustworthiness) of data over its life-cycle.
[[Encryption]] is created to safeguard data from being tampered


# [[Data Availability|Availability]]

A property that determines the origin of a given message.
