# Net Value Present

---

A method of calculating the expected net monetary gain or loss from a project by calculating the value of all expected future cash inflows and outflows at the present time.

$$NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{A_t}{(1+r)^t}$$
A positive NPV if financial value is a key criterion for project selection (the return from a project exceeds the cost of capital).
