1. Draw and identify the molecular shapes and predict the bond angles of phosphorus pentachloride (PCl<sub>5</sub>) and phosphorous trichloride (PCl<sub>3</sub>).
Phosphorus Pentachloride is a *trigonal bipyramid* with bond angles of 90° and 120°.

Phosphrous Trichloride is a *trigonal pyramidal* with a bond angle of 109.5°.

2. How do you know when a molecule is polar? Is PCl<sub>5</sub> a polar molecule? How about PCl<sub>3</sub>?
A molecule can be polar or nonpolar based on its symmetry. A symmetric molecule is nonpolar while an asymmetric molecule is polar due to usummetrical lone pair(s). This is due to the valence electrons of the molecules.
Another way to determine the molecule's polarity is its electronegativity. If it has an electronegativity between 0 and 0.4, it's nonpolar. Otherwise, it's polar. And if the molecule has a net dipole of 0, then it is nonpolar, otherwise its polar.

PCl<sub>5</sub> is a nonpolar molecule because it's symmetrically arranged around the central atom (P) hence it has no net dipole moment. PCl<sub>3</sub> is a polar molecule because it has 0.97 net dipole moment.
