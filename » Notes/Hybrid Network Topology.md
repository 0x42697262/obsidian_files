```
Hybrid topology is like a mix of different types of network topologies, such as star, bus, ring, or mesh. It's used to combine the advantages of these individual topologies to create a more robust and flexible network. In a hybrid topology, different parts of the network may use different topologies depending on what works best for that specific area or purpose.

In a hybrid topology, various segments of the network may utilize distinct topologies. For instance, one part of the network might employ a [[Star Network Topology|star topology]], where devices are connected to a central hub or switch, facilitating easy management and fault isolation. Simultaneously, another section of the network might utilize a [[Ring network topology|ring topology]], which offers redundancy and fault tolerance by creating a closed-loop connection. Additionally, segments could incorporate [[Bus Network Topology|bus]] or [[Mesh Network Topology|mesh]] topologies where applicable.
