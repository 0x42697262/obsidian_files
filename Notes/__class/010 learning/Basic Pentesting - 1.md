# Introduction
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Goal**: Gain root access and find other attack vectors. 
	A simple boot2root VM intended for beginners that has multiple remote vulnerabilities and privilege escalations. I'd be writing up all the possible things I did on this VM and will serve as my stepping stone for my future learnings.
