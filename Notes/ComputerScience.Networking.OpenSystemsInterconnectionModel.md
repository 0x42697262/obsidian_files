# Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model)

---

OSI Model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.

The purpose of OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software. This allows communication between all types of computer systems.

## History

- Established in 1957 by Internation Standards Organization
- A layered model that dominated data communications and networking literature before 1990, which was then replace by TCP/IP
