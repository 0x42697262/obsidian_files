# Wavelength

---

Wavelength is another characteristic of a signal traveling through a transmission medium. Wavelength binds the period or the frequency of a simple sine wave to the propagation speed of the medium. While the frequency of a signal is independent of the medium, the wavelength depends on both the frequency and the medium. Wavelength is a property of any type of signal.

In data communications, we often use wavelength to describe the transmission of light in an optical fiber. The wavelength is the distance a simple signal can travel in one period.

Wavelength can be calculated if one is given the propagation speed (the speed of light) and the period of the signal.

Formula:
$$\lambda=\frac{c}{f}$$

- the propagation speed of electromagnetic signals depends on the medium and on the frequency of the signal
- for example, in a vacuum, light is propagated with a speed of $3\times10^8 \frac{m}{s}$; the speed is lower in air and even lower in cable
- wavelength is normally measured in micrometers (microns) instead of meters

> [!NOTE]- Example 1
> Wavelength of red light (frequency = $4\times10^{14} Hz)$ in air is:
> $$\lambda=\frac{c}{f}$$ 
> $$\lambda=\frac{3\times10^8\frac{m}{s}}{4\times10^{14} Hz}$$ 
> $$\lambda=0.75\times10^{-6}m$$ 
> $$\lambda=0.75\mu m$$

_In coaxial or fiber-optic cable, however, the wavelength is shorter ($0.5\mu m$) because the propagation speed in the cable is decreased._
