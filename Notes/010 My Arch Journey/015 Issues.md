Some sort of issue with `paru` that I have no determined the cause yet.
`paru: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

Due to [SSL update](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/yn5o8a/comment/iv7qkme/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), `paru` needs to be rebuilt. I'll reinstall it soon, or later?
