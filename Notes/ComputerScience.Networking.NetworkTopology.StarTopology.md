A type of network configuration where all nodes (devices) are connected to a central node, often referred to as a "hub" or "switch".

Each node has a dedicated point-to-point connection with the hub/switch.

In Star Topology...

- it is usually used in [[ComputerScience.Networking.LocalAreaNetwork|Local Area Network]]
- each node have a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller (hub)
- devices are not directly linked to one another
- the controller acts as an exchange
