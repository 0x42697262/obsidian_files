## Week 2
### 1. What is computer ethics? Define.
Computer ethics deals with a set of moral principles regarding the regulation of the use of computers by an individual or group of people. This concerns the decision making in computing professionals from a professional and social conduct. 

### 2. As a computer science student, why do you need to be educated on computer ethics? Discuss.
I should be educated enough because I have to uphold integrity as being a decent human. Of course by not causing harm to others either with an intention and accidents. This would also help educate other people who are lacking in computer ethical manners.

### 3. What were two unexpected uses of social networking? Identify.
The use of business marketing and political campaigns. There are many more other unexpected uses of social networking but these two are the common ones.

### 4. What is the difference between negative and positive rights? Describe and give examples for each.
Negative rights refer to freedom from outside interference in certain activities while positive rights refer to rights that provide something that people need to secure their well being.

### 5. Distinguish between the negative and positive right to freedom of speech. Explain
Negative Rights allows people to exercise their freedom of speech without getting disturbed by outside influence like the government or individuals. This makes people "free" to present their speech however people are not free from the consequences of their speech. 
Postive Rights to freedom of speech implies that 3rd parties like government should be involved to ensure that the public are provided with all the speech. This means that freedom of speech also involves democracy.



# Week 3
### 1. What are two of Kant’s important ideas about ethics? Describe.
Kant's two important ideas are the Principle of Universality and Principle of Humanity. 
In Principle of Universality, if a proposed action is adopted by everyone, then it can be considered as a universal act. It is a basis for morality principle. It has been criticized that this principle is too strict. As for the Principle of Humanity, humans have inherent values then by treating them as tools rather than an end, the person woud be reduced to the level of an animal according to Kant. Also known as "formula of the end".

### 2. What is the utility principle in Utilitarianism? Explain.
Utilitarianism has its principles based on an act that promotes happiness to the majority of people in order for it to be considered as good or morality right even at the cost of producing pain to the minority as long as the main principle of "greatest happiness to the greatest number of people". So, if you were to steal from the rich and give it to the poor, that would be considered morally good in Utilitarianism.

### 3. What is the difference between act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism? Compare.
In Act Utilitarianism, it is the principle of applying a particular act in a particular situation or circumstance. So the basis of morality is the "act" itself to be considered as good or morally right. As for Rule Utilitarianism, morality is based on a certain rule or code of conduct that benefits the most people to be considered good or morally right. 
Act utilitarianism is all about the act and providing results whether it is good or bad. As for rule utilitarianism, it regards itself to a rule, law, or a code of conduct that is formulated from the utility principle.

### 4. What can be considered as morally good act in Natural Law ethical view? Explain.


### 5. What are the main differences in Kant’s Categorical Imperatives and Utilitarianism ethical views? Discuss.



# Week 4
### 1.What is intellectual property? Describe.
A concept, law, or idea that when a person creates a work or creation, they have rights to ownership. This prevents other people from stealing their works. So, when someone produces a music or writes a novel, they have the rights to copyright. When someone discovers or have a new invention, then they have the rights for patent. When someone creates a company, they the the rights to trademark. And so for other different kinds of rights as long as the person who created such works, concepts, or ideas are protected.
If put into otherwords, intellectual property is an intangible creative work, that is its ideas and not necesarrily the physical form, which is protected by the copyright and patent laws.

### 2. What is the common feature among the mentioned challenges to IP in using copyrighted materials with new technologies? Explain.
The common feature is related to digital technology or the rapid increase of the virtual world. Copyrighted materials are easily passed around because of how simple it is to duplicate the exact copyrighted materials like movies, music, novels, and lots of others. It gets harder to prevent someone from copying the materials transferred over the internet. Some even steal the work of the creators and profit from their creative works which is why this is  a common feature amongst the challenges in Intellectual Property.

### 3. What is the Fair Use Doctrine? Discuss.
Fair use is a way for the alleged party convicted of the copyright infringement as a defense for their side. It can be considered as fair use depending on the nature or purpose of the use of the copyrighted material. This allows people to copy and use copyrighted material for specific use. However, there are limits to how much can be copied from the material. These limits involves usually the purpose or character of the use if it's for commercial or nonprofif educational purpose, nature of the copyrighted work, amount of work that's copied proportional to your work, and its effect on the market compared to the original work. When the fair use doctrine is in effect, the material can be considered as a new work or a transformation. 

### 4. What are some of the responses to copyright infringement by the software industries? Describe.
There are multiple methods of responding to copyright infringement. One of these are, but not limited to, adding time limits to the software, DMCA notice and takedowns, DRMs that protecs the software, registering for a license, or even through subscriptions or software as a service. Even with these responses to the copyright infringement, it is still difficult to combat this issue especially software piracy. I think that their best way of responding to such issue is by implementing a subscription to their software and have a server that verifies the subscription if they are legitimate or not. Game industries does this well enough which is why internet connect is almost a requirement when registering for a software product.

### 5. What is digital rights management (DRM)? Characterize.
It is a tool for protecting software products from unauthorized modifications or distributions. It is a different method of restricting the use of copyrighted digital materials. This assures the owners of the software to be safe from getting their software stolen. However, DRMs can also cause issues to the consumers especially when it comes to games. There are cases where the consumer who owns the right to a particular game is restricted from transferring the product from one computer to another. Another case of DRMs providing issues is that it reduces the performance of the game due to how it alters and modifies the code of the software to protect it from modifications. DRMs simply exist to protect the rights of the owners of their work but with consequences that troubles some margin of the customers.

### 6. Is the “free” in free software means free of cost? Justify.
The "free" in free software does not mean "free" as in "free beer" but instead "free" as in "freedom". A software can be free of cost however it does not necessarily mean anyone have the freedom to modify, distribute, and profit from it. This is the nature of free and open-source softwares (FOSS). There are software that are free but they are only free of cost but not free of use in freedom.

### 7. What are the pros and cons on the calls for patenting software? Summarize.
The good side in patenting software is that this prevents others from stealing the creator's ideas and this allows him to take ownership of his creative works. However, this also leads issues to patents that prevents the development of the idea behind. One such example of this is patent trolls that its purpose is to disallow other creators from making profit from it.


# Week 5
### 1. What is hacking? Define.
There are multiple definitions of hacking over the course of these years. To start, hacking is an intentional, unauthorized access to computer systems. In early days of computing, hacking was termed as a brilliant or clever solution to a particular problem in programming. Hacking also is a term for making the computer command certain actions that were not intended by the programmers. On the later years, it slowly developed into a term rings a negative connotation to the public. Maybe we have hollywood movies to blame for this. The term hacking lately refers to gaining access to a computer system without authorization by any means necessary.
Hacking is not necessarily negative, it is possible to hack a system with authorization and those kind of people are security experts in finding vulnerabilities and securing the system.

### 2. In the beginning when the term “hacker” was coined, who is called as such? Is he a notorious person as known now? Justify.
The hacker was coined after the two smart MIT students Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson by instructing a mainframe computer to do specific tasks outside of its intended purpose. The hack was so much better than the original program because it finishes its tasks faster. These two people are known  for creating UNIX. However, they are not much known to the general public since these two notorious people are not associated with business that much.

### 3. What are the ethical dilemmas of a “white hat” hacker testing for vulnerabilities of a system? Discuss.
Intention and harm. As long as the intention is good or morally right and there is no harm done then it is considered ethical. Security professionals that have white hat hacking as their career have strict code to follow and that is by acquiring a legitmate authorization for pentesting vulnerabilities but some white hat hackers does not do that and so they hack the system without autorization even if their intention was good. For example, a white hat hacker starts pentesting a company website to see if there are vulnerabilites that could be problematic. For the hacker, he did it with the intent of disclosing such vulnerability when found so everyone benefits from it. But the act itself has not been approved so this is a dilemma.

### 4. What is identity theft? What kind of information usually cyber-theft steals? Describe.
Identity theft is stealing someone's or a random person's personal information and for misuse case. Criminals use it for fraud or impersonating the stolen identity of a person. They usually steal financial and personal information although it is not only limited to that as they could also steal your birth certification, VISA, social security number, and other sensitive personal documents.

### 5. What are some of the techniques used by cyber-criminals to steal identities? Describe.
Criminals typically phish people online like their banking sites or social media accounts, or they can steal identities through social engineering by smishing and vishing. Criminals can also setup fake job application posts that harvests personal information from a resume.

### 6. What suggestions do you have for resolving the issues created by differences in laws by different countries? What do you think would work, or would not? Discuss.
There is no universal solution that every countries can agree upon however countries can make agreements with each others on what laws can be appiled to individual countries. If we borrow the same ideas from the agreement of prohibiting nuclear weapons, then there will still be countries that would not agree to that treaty. Which is why it is very difficult to implement laws internationally since countries can either agree to it or not. An example of this would be piracy where it's illegal to distribute the copyrighted material in one country but it is legal to be distributed in another.


# Week 6
### 1. What are the key aspects of privacy? Describe.
There are three key aspects of privacy: freedom of intrusion, control of information about oneself, and freedom from surveillance. Firstly, we should have the rights to not disclose any of our personal information. Secondly, we should be able to control how much information we provide. If someone does not want to reveal any information, then let them have that freedom and choice to do so. Lastly, we should have the freedom from surveillance, no one should have the authority to fully track or record our movements whenever and wherever we are. It is not about "there is nothing to hide" but instead "we need to have some form of respect and dignity". If someone is not an advocate for privacy, they should leave their curtains open at night because "they have nothing to hide".

### 2. What are the risks on privacy with the use of computing technologies? Summarize. Categorize.
The main risk of privacy is through social media and the consumer aspect of computing. Especially when billions of people have smartphones that they can use anytime. Everything that we do on the internet stays on the internet, the data alone of a person may be of no use but if they were taken as a group or collection of personal information then it can be used to analyzed the relation between the masses and use it on marketing, advertising, politics, cencorship, and much more. Organizations that sells sensitive personal information are data brokers. They could've taken these from public websites through open-source intelligence or social media websites that sells its users data, or it could even be from data leaks. A person with a smartphone gets tracked because of the various apps they have installed on their phones, it is a gold mine for businesses. This is why we should be wary of the information we provide online since the only ones who can protect our data are the businesses and organizations handling them.

### 3. What the Philippines’ Data Privacy Act of 2012 is all about? Explain.
Rephrasing the Republic Act No. 10173, it is about protecting an individual's right to data privacy regarding personal information in information and communication systems be it in the government or private sectors such as businesses or nonprofit organizations. Due to this act, organizations should oblige in securing and protecting an individual's personal information. Carelessly handling sensitive personal information can potentially lead them to court trials. Filipinos can then rest assure that their data are protected properly and should only be used accordingly based on their stated purposes. Otherwise, one can file a lawsuit against an organization.

### 4. What are the underlying principles of the Data Privacy Act of the Philippines with respect to the processing of personal data? Discuss.


### 5. What types of personal information are covered by the Data Privacy Act of 2012? Describe.

### 6. What is the main (ethical) issue in the business sector that has implications on privacy? How about for the government systems? Compare.

### 7. What are the two kinds of approaches in protecting one’s privacy? Describe.

### 8. What are the two (2) contrasting viewpoints on privacy under rights and laws? Summarize.


# Week 7
### 1. What is professional ethics? What is professional code of ethics? Compare.

### 2. For computing professionals, which organizations develop professional codes of ethics? What are the core values espouse by these organizations’ code of conduct for computer professionals? Describe.

### 3. What are the ethical guidelines and professional responsibilities for computer professionals? Summarize.

### 4. What are the two (2) major phases in ethical scenario analysis? Describe.

### 5. In the analysis phase of a scenario., which part you think is the most critical one? Justify.
