# Executive Summary
The topics that interests me the most are privacy, hacking, and intellectual property that is because it relates me to my *almost* everyday living of life. My reasoning to that is because I pretty much use the computer almost everyday and the ethical aspects relating to intellectual property is an everyday occuring event to me. Not that I make profits from other people's creative works but I make a profit as a consumer, that is: enjoyment. I am an advocate for privacy, prioritizing it at all cost although I make some exceptions for myself sometimes. Hacking on the otherhand, it's a topic that interests me but no effort in putting action to actually learn its concepts.

The topics that bored me the most are ethical theories and professional ethics. There is nothing for me to suggest since the boredom comes from within myself as it is not my preference to learn this type of lesson. Although I must do it for the sake of my grades. I sitck to my computing actions of "if it does not harm anyone, but still makes everyone happy then it's all gucci". I cannot simply apply one ethical theory in my life, that's not how it works since not every ethical theories are perfect. One might need to mix and match them depending on the situation.

I do not really think there are learning materials that I found engaging. If anything, I simply read the text on online sources or watch the video material provided. I do not consider video materials as engaging. Well, it depends on how a video is presented but on this class, none of them are engaging enough.

I think my best learning realization is about intellectual property. Anyone can easily argue that creators have the rights to their own creations and can have patents for it. But however, ideas or concepts are not original. It never is and will never be. The ideas that you have think of are already existing ideas that have existed around you. For example, try thinking of a face of a non-existent person. You might say you can but the truth is that person already exists somewhere or is a combination of faces of multiple people. So, I realized that when someone creates a "new" idea and "owns" them, it can sometimes restrict other people from further developing that idea.

This class would have been a lot interesting if the learning materials were not all youtube videos from a decade old video upload. I mean sure we students from this class can dig deeper and it is our job to do so, but on this level it just sets my expectation low. Did I enjoy this class? I don't know, you tell me. So I shall ask "Did you enjoy teaching this class?"

# My Weekly Learning Logs
## Week 2
The very first lesson in class, I am a bit interested since it is about computer ethics. I was expecting that the topics are related to real life events. So this is my learning log for this week's topic.
### 1. What is computer ethics? Define.
Computer ethics deals with a set of moral principles regarding the regulation of the use of computers by an individual or group of people. This concerns the decision making in computing professionals from a professional and social conduct. 

### 2. As a computer science student, why do you need to be educated on computer ethics? Discuss.
I should be educated enough because I have to uphold integrity as being a decent human. Of course by not causing harm to others either with an intention and accidents. This would also help educate other people who are lacking in computer ethical manners.

### 3. What were two unexpected uses of social networking? Identify.
The use of business marketing and political campaigns. There are many more other unexpected uses of social networking but these two are the common ones.

### 4. What is the difference between negative and positive rights? Describe and give examples for each.
Negative rights refer to freedom from outside interference in certain activities while positive rights refer to rights that provide something that people need to secure their well being.

### 5. Distinguish between the negative and positive right to freedom of speech. Explain
Negative Rights allows people to exercise their freedom of speech without getting disturbed by outside influence like the government or individuals. This makes people "free" to present their speech however people are not free from the consequences of their speech. 
Postive Rights to freedom of speech implies that 3rd parties like government should be involved to ensure that the public are provided with all the speech. This means that freedom of speech also involves democracy.

---

After this lesson, I was intrigued since it tackled about the freedom of speech especially when cencorship is quite strong for certain countries.

# Week 3
I expected a bit more of what happened last week so I considered this learning log as a bit uninteresting as I do not like concepts as much when it comes to computing.
### 1. What are two of Kant’s important ideas about ethics? Describe.
Kant's two important ideas are the Principle of Universality and Principle of Humanity. 
In Principle of Universality, if a proposed action is adopted by everyone, then it can be considered as a universal act. It is a basis for morality principle. It has been criticized that this principle is too strict. As for the Principle of Humanity, humans have inherent values then by treating them as tools rather than an end, the person woud be reduced to the level of an animal according to Kant. Also known as "formula of the end".

### 2. What is the utility principle in Utilitarianism? Explain.
Utilitarianism has its principles based on an act that promotes happiness to the majority of people in order for it to be considered as good or morality right even at the cost of producing pain to the minority as long as the main principle of "greatest happiness to the greatest number of people". So, if you were to steal from the rich and give it to the poor, that would be considered morally good in Utilitarianism.

### 3. What is the difference between act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism? Compare.
In Act Utilitarianism, it is the principle of applying a particular act in a particular situation or circumstance. So the basis of morality is the "act" itself to be considered as good or morally right. As for Rule Utilitarianism, morality is based on a certain rule or code of conduct that benefits the most people to be considered good or morally right. 
Act utilitarianism is all about the act and providing results whether it is good or bad. As for rule utilitarianism, it regards itself to a rule, law, or a code of conduct that is formulated from the utility principle.

### 4. What can be considered as morally good act in Natural Law ethical view? Explain.
I think what can be considered as a morallyl good act for natural law is that if we follow the seven basic goods then it can be considered as morally good. For example, reproduction for the purpose of giving birth to a new life is morally good however if the act has another end or purpose then it is not considered to be morally good.

### 5. What are the main differences in Kant’s Categorical Imperatives and Utilitarianism ethical views? Discuss.
Their main difference for Kantianism is that the act must be as a means of an end because it is a duty while in Utilitarianism ethical views the act can be considered morally good if it produces the greatest number of people. These two ethical views can sometimes overlap however there are differences between them. Kantianism is more inclined to sake of duty and a virtue by intrinsict value. So, even if the act in utilitarianism is morally good but it does not mean it is also morally good for Kantianism. Such example is stealing from the rich and giving it to the poor. Utilitarianism would say it is morally good since it benefits the largest amount of people however in Kantianism, it is not because it cannot be applied universally according to Principle of Universality. 

---
Although I was not interested on this lesson, I was able to brush up my previous semesters lesson for ethics. I think I had more understanding in the past than now, or maybe the opposite.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Week 4
Looking into this lesson, I immediately brougth back my interest to this class since it tooks about intellectual property. As a proud P-flag person, I have no moral or ethical issues of what I have been doing ever since I used a computer. Ever. Here's my learning log for this week's lesson.
### 1.What is intellectual property? Describe.
A concept, law, or idea that when a person creates a work or creation, they have rights to ownership. This prevents other people from stealing their works. So, when someone produces a music or writes a novel, they have the rights to copyright. When someone discovers or have a new invention, then they have the rights for patent. When someone creates a company, they the the rights to trademark. And so for other different kinds of rights as long as the person who created such works, concepts, or ideas are protected.
If put into otherwords, intellectual property is an intangible creative work, that is its ideas and not necesarrily the physical form, which is protected by the copyright and patent laws.

### 2. What is the common feature among the mentioned challenges to IP in using copyrighted materials with new technologies? Explain.
The common feature is related to digital technology or the rapid increase of the virtual world. Copyrighted materials are easily passed around because of how simple it is to duplicate the exact copyrighted materials like movies, music, novels, and lots of others. It gets harder to prevent someone from copying the materials transferred over the internet. Some even steal the work of the creators and profit from their creative works which is why this is  a common feature amongst the challenges in Intellectual Property.

### 3. What is the Fair Use Doctrine? Discuss.
Fair use is a way for the alleged party convicted of the copyright infringement as a defense for their side. It can be considered as fair use depending on the nature or purpose of the use of the copyrighted material. This allows people to copy and use copyrighted material for specific use. However, there are limits to how much can be copied from the material. These limits involves usually the purpose or character of the use if it's for commercial or nonprofif educational purpose, nature of the copyrighted work, amount of work that's copied proportional to your work, and its effect on the market compared to the original work. When the fair use doctrine is in effect, the material can be considered as a new work or a transformation. 

### 4. What are some of the responses to copyright infringement by the software industries? Describe.
There are multiple methods of responding to copyright infringement. One of these are, but not limited to, adding time limits to the software, DMCA notice and takedowns, DRMs that protecs the software, registering for a license, or even through subscriptions or software as a service. Even with these responses to the copyright infringement, it is still difficult to combat this issue especially software piracy. I think that their best way of responding to such issue is by implementing a subscription to their software and have a server that verifies the subscription if they are legitimate or not. Game industries does this well enough which is why internet connect is almost a requirement when registering for a software product.

### 5. What is digital rights management (DRM)? Characterize.
It is a tool for protecting software products from unauthorized modifications or distributions. It is a different method of restricting the use of copyrighted digital materials. This assures the owners of the software to be safe from getting their software stolen. However, DRMs can also cause issues to the consumers especially when it comes to games. There are cases where the consumer who owns the right to a particular game is restricted from transferring the product from one computer to another. Another case of DRMs providing issues is that it reduces the performance of the game due to how it alters and modifies the code of the software to protect it from modifications. DRMs simply exist to protect the rights of the owners of their work but with consequences that troubles some margin of the customers.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 6. Is the “free” in free software means free of cost? Justify.
The "free" in free software does not mean "free" as in "free beer" but instead "free" as in "freedom". A software can be free of cost however it does not necessarily mean anyone have the freedom to modify, distribute, and profit from it. This is the nature of free and open-source softwares (FOSS). There are software that are free but they are only free of cost but not free of use in freedom.

### 7. What are the pros and cons on the calls for patenting software? Summarize.
The good side in patenting software is that this prevents others from stealing the creator's ideas and this allows him to take ownership of his creative works. However, this also leads issues to patents that prevents the development of the idea behind. One such example of this is patent trolls that its purpose is to disallow other creators from making profit from it.

---
As much as how I know about the ethical aspects in intellectual property, I would still do it regardless of the act since: 1) I have no money, 2) if I have money, I will rather buy food, and 3) some creative works are not available in our country.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Week 5
Ah, well, this looks a bit more interesting than before, of course definitely not by experience I can guarantee it as much as the half-life of a technetium-85 isotope. 
### 1. What is hacking? Define.
There are multiple definitions of hacking over the course of these years. To start, hacking is an intentional, unauthorized access to computer systems. In early days of computing, hacking was termed as a brilliant or clever solution to a particular problem in programming. Hacking also is a term for making the computer command certain actions that were not intended by the programmers. On the later years, it slowly developed into a term rings a negative connotation to the public. Maybe we have hollywood movies to blame for this. The term hacking lately refers to gaining access to a computer system without authorization by any means necessary.
Hacking is not necessarily negative, it is possible to hack a system with authorization and those kind of people are security experts in finding vulnerabilities and securing the system.

### 2. In the beginning when the term “hacker” was coined, who is called as such? Is he a notorious person as known now? Justify.
The hacker was coined after the two smart MIT students Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson by instructing a mainframe computer to do specific tasks outside of its intended purpose. The hack was so much better than the original program because it finishes its tasks faster. These two people are known  for creating UNIX. However, they are not much known to the general public since these two notorious people are not associated with business that much.

### 3. What are the ethical dilemmas of a “white hat” hacker testing for vulnerabilities of a system? Discuss.
Intention and harm. As long as the intention is good or morally right and there is no harm done then it is considered ethical. Security professionals that have white hat hacking as their career have strict code to follow and that is by acquiring a legitmate authorization for pentesting vulnerabilities but some white hat hackers does not do that and so they hack the system without autorization even if their intention was good. For example, a white hat hacker starts pentesting a company website to see if there are vulnerabilites that could be problematic. For the hacker, he did it with the intent of disclosing such vulnerability when found so everyone benefits from it. But the act itself has not been approved so this is a dilemma.

### 4. What is identity theft? What kind of information usually cyber-theft steals? Describe.
Identity theft is stealing someone's or a random person's personal information and for misuse case. Criminals use it for fraud or impersonating the stolen identity of a person. They usually steal financial and personal information although it is not only limited to that as they could also steal your birth certification, VISA, social security number, and other sensitive personal documents.

### 5. What are some of the techniques used by cyber-criminals to steal identities? Describe.
Criminals typically phish people online like their banking sites or social media accounts, or they can steal identities through social engineering by smishing and vishing. Criminals can also setup fake job application posts that harvests personal information from a resume.

### 6. What suggestions do you have for resolving the issues created by differences in laws by different countries? What do you think would work, or would not? Discuss.
There is no universal solution that every countries can agree upon however countries can make agreements with each others on what laws can be appiled to individual countries. If we borrow the same ideas from the agreement of prohibiting nuclear weapons, then there will still be countries that would not agree to that treaty. Which is why it is very difficult to implement laws internationally since countries can either agree to it or not. An example of this would be piracy where it's illegal to distribute the copyrighted material in one country but it is legal to be distributed in another.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---
The term "hacking" gets thrown out a lot of times that it sometimes does not fit in the situation. You open up with your riced terminal then they call you a "hacker". You study computer science or IT, then you get called a "hacker". If sex education is important, so should be using the computer.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Week 6
My favorite part of this class, the privacy aspect. If you can pick one, would you rather have zero privacy but full security or zero security but full privacy? My answer is of course full privacy with zero security. Security does not ensure privacy however privacy can ensure you security through isolation.
### 1. What are the key aspects of privacy? Describe.
There are three key aspects of privacy: freedom of intrusion, control of information about oneself, and freedom from surveillance. Firstly, we should have the rights to not disclose any of our personal information. Secondly, we should be able to control how much information we provide. If someone does not want to reveal any information, then let them have that freedom and choice to do so. Lastly, we should have the freedom from surveillance, no one should have the authority to fully track or record our movements whenever and wherever we are. It is not about "there is nothing to hide" but instead "we need to have some form of respect and dignity". If someone is not an advocate for privacy, they should leave their curtains open at night because "they have nothing to hide".

### 2. What are the risks on privacy with the use of computing technologies? Summarize. Categorize.
The main risk of privacy is through social media and the consumer aspect of computing. Especially when billions of people have smartphones that they can use anytime. Everything that we do on the internet stays on the internet, the data alone of a person may be of no use but if they were taken as a group or collection of personal information then it can be used to analyzed the relation between the masses and use it on marketing, advertising, politics, cencorship, and much more. Organizations that sells sensitive personal information are data brokers. They could've taken these from public websites through open-source intelligence or social media websites that sells its users data, or it could even be from data leaks. A person with a smartphone gets tracked because of the various apps they have installed on their phones, it is a gold mine for businesses. This is why we should be wary of the information we provide online since the only ones who can protect our data are the businesses and organizations handling them.

### 3. What the Philippines’ Data Privacy Act of 2012 is all about? Explain.
Rephrasing the Republic Act No. 10173, it is about protecting an individual's right to data privacy regarding personal information in information and communication systems be it in the government or private sectors such as businesses or nonprofit organizations. Due to this act, organizations should oblige in securing and protecting an individual's personal information. Carelessly handling sensitive personal information can potentially lead them to court trials. Filipinos can then rest assure that their data are protected properly and should only be used accordingly based on their stated purposes. Otherwise, one can file a lawsuit against an organization.

### 4. What are the underlying principles of the Data Privacy Act of the Philippines with respect to the processing of personal data? Discuss.
>[!INFO]
>SEC. 11. _General Data Privacy Principles._ – The processing of personal information shall be allowed, subject to compliance with the requirements of this Act and other laws allowing disclosure of information to the public and adherence to the principles of transparency, legitimate purpose and proportionality.

There are six underlying principles of data privacy act. These personal information must, be collected and used for a specific and legitimate purposes to which then must be processed fairly and according to the law. When such purpose is a necessity, it must be up to date, accurate, and relevant, then the inaccurate and incomplete data must be updated, destroyed, or restricted from access. Personal information collected should only be adequate and not excessive with relation to its purpose. And to only store the personal information collected for a specific period of time that is in according to its purpose which must also be kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5. What types of personal information are covered by the Data Privacy Act of 2012? Describe.
These types are sensitive personal information which means the personal information of a person and privileged information which refers to any and all forms of data. Personal information can be anything as long as it can identify an individual as for the privileged information that regards with the court of the law and information that does not need to be disclosed in legal proceedings.

### 6. What is the main (ethical) issue in the business sector that has implications on privacy? How about for the government systems? Compare.
Data collection for both business sector and government systems. In business sector, businesses mine personal data and collect them to be used for marketing and personalization which can help their market revenue increase in sales. Which is why sometimes you'll notice that you have certain advertisements targeted at you, this is called targeted ads. Some are called personalized ads that are based on your preferences. As for the government systems, data collection is mostly used for surveillance and national security. Millions of its citizens are monitored to detect terrorism and prevent them, or to even catch wanted criminals.

### 7. What are the two kinds of approaches in protecting one’s privacy? Describe.
The two kinds of approaches to protect against one's privacy are by using privacy enhancing-technologies and throught the Rights and Laws. In the technology aspect, data can be encrypted to protect them against unauthorized access or use standard procedures in protecting privacy. As for the rights and laws there are two kinds, these are free market view where the consumers have the freedom of choice and consumer protection view which protects the consumers from breaching their privacy. 

### 8. What are the two (2) contrasting viewpoints on privacy under rights and laws? Summarize.
The two contrasting viewpoints are: Free Market View and Consumer Protection View. Free market view allows the consumers to have freedom of choice, the diversity of individual tastes and values, and freedom in general. As for the consumer protection view, the consumers privacy should be protected by the organization handling their data. Consumers should also be educated on what they do not have knowledge of.

---
A bit lacking on this lesson but it was alright I guess. If you have a social media account, you should be aware of the actions that you do every moment. Who knows that every picture you upload, every memes you share, every comments you engage can potentially be used against you in the future.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Week 7
The last lesson of this class, quite intrigued how quick it ended. This is my last learning log.
### 1. What is professional ethics? What is professional code of ethics? Compare.
Professional ethics is sort of like an expectation for investors and consumers to have quality standards on their products or services. It makes the investors and consumers trust the business. This is not only limited to the two, but also involves the relationships with and responsibilities towards others who use the products and services including to whom it affects.
Professional code of ethics just simply makes sure that businesses are behaving in such a manner that is socially acceptable and respectful of one another.
Professional ethics focuses more on personal and corporate standards that are expected to have certain professional code of ethics behaviors.

### 2. For computing professionals, which organizations develop professional codes of ethics? What are the core values espouse by these organizations’ code of conduct for computer professionals? Describe.
These organizationis are Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and Tralee Institute of Technology. They have basic ethical values of honesty and fairness, responsibility to respect confidentiality, maintain professional competence, being aware of relevant laws and owner contracts and agreements, upholds respect, protect privacy, and respects property rights.

### 3. What are the ethical guidelines and professional responsibilities for computer professionals? Summarize.
There are a lot of ethical guidelines and professional responsibilities, although the most important thing to consider is that communicate, respect, understand, and provide honest behaviors to the clients or customers. If the business sector where to do this, they will be successful. Although the same thing can be said when they try to unethical, business sectors can still succeed. 

### 4. What are the two (2) major phases in ethical scenario analysis? Describe.
The first phase is the brainstorming phase where you list all the stakeholders then list the risks, problems, issues, consequences and then the benefiits. Then the next phase is the analysis phase where you identify the responsibilities of the decision maker and the rights of stakeholders. Which then we consider the effect to the stakeholders and after that we categorize them.

### 5. In the analysis phase of a scenario., which part you think is the most critical one? Justify.
I think the most important part is identifying the rights of the stakeholders since the next steps would not have any meaning if the stakeholders did not have any rights. Like for example, the stakeholders can get harm but they do not have the rights to protect themselves. Then when we categorize that from a potential action, we might as well consider their harm as acceptable and neglect it. Which is why I think identifying their rights is thte most critical step in analysis phase.

---
I think I am a bit lost on this lesson. This takes a lot of good morality to continue on my end. I did not expect it would take a bit longer to understand this topic.

To sum it all up, what I have learned in this semester class is that we ought to apply the ethical views in computing technology although since this field is not fairly new, it isn't old either. There may still have some mishaps regarding the ethical aspects that someone may not be aware of.
