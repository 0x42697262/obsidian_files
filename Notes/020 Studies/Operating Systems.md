## What is an Operating System?
 - middle man between user and hardware (an intermediary)
 - **provide an environment** for the user to execute programs with convenience and efficiency
 - a **system program** that is implemented in either *software* or *firmware*
 - set of **procedures** for driving the resources of the system

Operating System is that one program that is always running, which is called the [[Kernel]].

### Why are Operating Systems introduced and developed?
> [!INFO]- Why?
> Knowledge of how operating systems work is crucial to proper, efficient, effective, and secure programming.

**Reasons**:
1. Provides convenient environment for development and execution of programs
2. The scheduler, by scheduling processes for performance

## Operating System as a Resource Allocator
Manages resources:
- CPU time
- memory space
- file storage space
- I/O devices
which allocates them to specific programs/users as necessary

Should decide which requests are allocates the resources should there be a conflicting requests. 
We can view OS as a resource allocator

[[Control Program]] manages execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.

## Types of Operating Systems
1. [[Batch Processing]] 
2. [[Multiprogramming]]
3. [[Time Sharing]]
