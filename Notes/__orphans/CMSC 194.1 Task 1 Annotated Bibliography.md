Ching, C. H., & Su, C. H. (2011). A Game-based learning system for improving student's learning effectiveness in system analysis course, *Procedia - Social Behavioral and Sciences*, vol. 31, pp. 669-675.

In this article, Ching and Su developed a game-based learning system to show that research claiming that mapping the course content into a game can increase the learning interest and motivation of the students by acquiring more of their attention. This study is done through quasi-experimental design where the students are separated into two groups: experimental and control grouprs. The authors have pointed out that through repeated self-learning, and ongoing interaction and feedback, the students are learning much better through game-based learning system that students who uses traditional face-to-face class. Based on the conclusions, it may be possible to incorporate high level of interactivity and feedback without the need of a game-based learning system.

However, the authors' study solely focuses on interactive portion of the learning process and the author may be implying that traditional face-to-face classes do not have the same interactive level of learning as game-based system. The process behind traditional face-to-face classes was not implied by the authors. 

This articles is not related to my research and as such I would have no use for it however this can provide me insights on to my study in writing my thesis paper.

Ishizue et al. (2020, April). PVC.js: visualizing C programs on web browsers for novices. *Heliyon*, 6(4), e03806. 

In this article, the authors proposed a visualization tool, PlayVisualizerC.js (PVC.js) for memory management that can help novice programmers in learning the C language because the existing tools available have problems that hinder their use mainly: capability, instability, and usability. This proposal solves the three issues based on the results of their two experiments that PVC.js is more effective for novice programmers in understanding the program than existing tools.

However, the authors have pointed out in there limitations that PVC.js is made specifically for novice programmers thus advanced features included from other existing tools are not included as this proposed tool is a visualization tool. It would be much more helpful to the novice programmers that compilation errors are shown to the user.

This article does not directly relates to my research study however it might help me in the future in supplementing as an additional info.
