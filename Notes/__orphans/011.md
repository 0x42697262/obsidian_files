The Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about a revolution in the way we
interact with the world around us. With the rapid increase of IoT devices we are
now able to control and monitor our environments in ways that were previously
impossible. These devices ranges from smart home systems which can be con-
trolled by a smartphone through an app to industrial control systems. However,
as the number of IoT devices increases, so does the potential attack vectors for
cyber attacks targetting the IoT device itself or the smartphone application used
to control and monitor the device. Mainly due to poor security practices in de-
veloping the application and indaquate software engineering design in securing
against cyber attacks for the IoT device causing minimal security (Barcena &
Wueest, 2015). This research aims to investigate the most prevalent vulnerabil-
ities in smartphone apps for IoT devices through vulnerability assessment and
penetration testing (VAPT), and to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities
through penetration testing. The review will draw on research conducted about
vulnerabilities in smartphone apps for IoT devices, identifying vulnerabilities
in IoT devices like modem routers, and show mitigations for the vulnerabilities
found in smartphone app and IoT devices.

IoT devices are usually designed and manufactured by Original Design Man-
ufacturers (ODMs), which are companies that create products for other compa-
nies to sell under their own brand. This can lead to multiple companies using
the same ODM company, which means that the firmware created by the ODM

is used in a wide range of different devices. However, the firmware made by the
ODM can be vulnerable, meaning that it contains bugs and security weaknesses
that can be exploited by attackers. This can put the devices using the same
ODM firmware at risk of cyber attacks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited
to gain unauthorized access to the devices, steal sensitive information, or dis-
rupt the device’s normal operation. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that
many IoT devices are not designed with security in mind and are not regularly
updated or patched, which means that these vulnerabilities can persist for a
long time when ODMs does not provide the full source code of the firmware

Penetration testing can be performed through two methods, automated pen-
testing and manual pentesting. Automated penetration testing allows individu-
als without extensive cybersecurity knowledge to perform tests and evaluations
on IoT systems. Although automated penetration testing tools do not guar-
antee success in an actual attack, it is still possible for an attacker to exploit
vulnerabilities found through the use of such tools. Automated pentesting tools
exists to aid security experts in their jobs (Rak, Salzillo, & Romeo, 2020). Pen-
etration testing is a time consuming task hence the need for automated tools.
Manual penetration testing utilizes frameworks, and there are multiple frame-
works available for use. Some examples of frameworks that can be used for
manual penetration testing include: OWASP Testing Framework, PTES (Pene-
tration Testing Execution Standard), OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing
Methodology Manual), NIST SP800-115, and ISSAF (Information Systems Se-
curity Assessment Framework). While there are various other penetra-
tion testing frameworks available, the ones listed are commonly utilized within
the industry

One of the key recommendations for mitigating IoT attacks is to ensure
good software engineering practices and the ability to maintain and update the
device’s codebase. Firmware level vulnerabilities can be prevented by ODMs
implementing safe practices during the development and manufacturing pro-
cess. When safe practices are not implemented by ODMs, OEMs can take steps
to patch the firmware themselves. Another method of mitigating software vul-
nerabilities in IoT devices, particularly those integrated with smartphones, is
to implement proper access control mechanisms to manage the device’s permis-
sions. This restricts the users from performinng risky actions and potentially
stop malicious behaviors from attackers

In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that IoT devices’ firmware and
smartphone applications are vulnerable to attacks. These vulnerabilities can
arise from poor software engineering practices in the development of firmware
and applications. It is crucial for Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) and
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to implement good software engi-
neering practices to prevent these vulnerabilities. Additionally, implementing

proper access control mechanisms to manage the device’s permissions can also
help to mitigate these vulnerabilities. It is important to note that IoT security
is an ongoing process and it is crucial to continuously monitor and update the
security measures to adapt to new threats and vulnerabilities.
