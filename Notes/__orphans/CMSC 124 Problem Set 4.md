CMSC 124 Problem Set 4
**Topic Coverage**: Lexical and Syntax Analysis 

---

### 1. Why is BNF considered advantageous over using an informal syntax description?
BNF is consistent to use across all sorts of grammar when applicable since unlike informal syntax description, hence the reason why BNF descriptions are clear and concise. This makes it easy for humans and software systems to analyze. Since syntax analyzers can be based directly from BNF, it would also be easy to implement and maintain the syntax analyzer.

### 2. Describe the three approaches to building a lexical analyzer. Which of those approaches are most commonly used, and why?


### 3. Describe the complexity of parsing algorithms. What is the parsing problem, and why is it considered a problem?

### 4. What is a left recursion? Why is it not possible to have a grammar having a left recursion as a basis for a top-down parser, and how can this be corrected?

### 5. Describe the purpose of a parse stack in an LR parser.
