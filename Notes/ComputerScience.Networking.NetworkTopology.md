# Network Topology

---

Network Topology is the geometric representation of the relationship of all links and linking devices (nodes) to one another.

**Categories**:

1. `Physical Topology`: refers to the actual physical connections of how the network is arranged
2. `Logical Topology`: refers to the higher-level idea of how the network is arranged

**Types**:

1. [[ComputerScience.Networking.NetworkTopology.MeshTopology|Mesh Topology]] (Basic)
2. [[ComputerScience.Networking.NetworkTopology.StarTopology|Star Topology]] (Basic)
3. [[ComputerScience.Networking.NetworkTopology.BusTopology|Bus Topology]] (Basic)
