# What is this obsidian repository for?
Trying to take notes by using Zettelkasten Method where every notes (the files here) should be atomic.

# Directory Structure
```
/Notes
├── __class
├── __index
└── __orphans
```
`__class` contains my categories, but not specifically the topics itself.

`__index` contains the table of contents.

`__orphans` default directory for new files with no class.

## \_\_class
Each class in this directory should have an index with this format: `0## <string>`. 
There should be an index file named identical to the class directory. This will be used by `__index`.

# PLANS
- [ ] Reorganize notes
	- [x] Canvas
	- [x] Daily Notes
	- [x] Excalidraw
	- [x] Kanban
	- [ ] Moving of new files
- [ ] Create a frontend for markdown

# How to use this vault?
Do a `git clone https://github.com/KrulYuno/obsidian_files.git` then open the vault in Obsidian. I think plugins are already included.
