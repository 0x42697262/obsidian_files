# What is this obsidian repository for?
Trying to take notes by using Zettelkasten Method where every notes (the files here) should be atomic.

This notes must comply with compass of zettelkasten.

`from` where is this information taken?
`leads to` what insights does it provide?
`similar ideas` what ideas that are similar?
`opposing ideas` what ideas that are unalike?

# Directory Structure
```
/Notes
├── __class
├── __index
└── __orphans
```
`__class` contains my categories, but not specifically the topics itself.

`__index` contains the table of contents.

`__orphans` default directory for new files with no class.

## \_\_class
Each class in this directory should have an index with this format: `0## <string>`. 
There should be an index file named identical to the class directory. This will be used by `__index`.
