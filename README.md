# What is this repo for?
Taking notes.

# Why are you uploading your notes on Github?
I love git.

# Can't you just use a normal backup method?
I don't want to use cloud storage, and git just works well.

# Can I ~~steal~~ use your notes?
You can, but why? Information dumped here are probably lacking.

# We both have the same assignment on your notes
No, we don't. You're hallucinating. This repo is just **notes**. *I do not save my assignments here. Definitely not.*

# Why are your notes unorganized?
I am still learning.
