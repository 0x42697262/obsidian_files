This is use for storing notes (? highly questionable) about just anything I do online and irl.

# Setup

1. Get [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download) first.
2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/0x42697262/obsidian_files.git
```

3. Import the cloned repository in Obsidian.

Note that plugins are already provided. Some are what I use but some are what I forgot its functions for. Also themes are provided there... So, gotta do something about it if you dislike the themes.
