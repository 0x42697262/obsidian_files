- in which components are weakly associated (have breakable relationships) with each other, and thus changes in one component least affect existence or performance of another component. 
- in which each of its components has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components. Subareas include the coupling of classes, interfaces, data, and services.
