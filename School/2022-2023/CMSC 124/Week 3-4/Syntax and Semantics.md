# Syntax
- is a sentence structured
- the form of programs are written
- must have correct definitions to not have syntax errors


# General Syntactic Criteria
### Readability
- programs are self-documenting (:tf:)
- the closer the language to the user, the easier it is
	- COBOL is the most readable for English
	- PROLOG is the most readable for ~~magicians~~ logicians
- requires more verbose constructs

### Writability
- conflicts with readability features
	- a more readable program is more difficult to write
- requires more regular and concise structure 

### Ease of Translation
- concern towards the machine regarding language execution
- measured by size of the compiler for the language
	- lesser syntactic is better
- affects the popularity of the language

### Lack of Ambiguity
- must have only one interpretation
