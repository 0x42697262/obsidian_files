## 1. Give the basic difference between a declarative and imperative language. Then, classify
the following as either imperative or declarative.
Imperative Language is an explicitly defined language where computations are performed as sequences in RAM that focuses more on the teps in acquiring a result hence why it is a procedural programming paradigm. Declarative Language is an explicity defined language which focuses more on the result. It is a type of logical programming paradigm that is considered as a higher level of concept.

| Language  |     Classification      |
| --------- |:-----------------------:|
| FORTRAN   | Imperative<sup>1</sup>  |
| Algol-60  | Imperative<sup>2</sup>  |
| Lisp      | Declarative<sup>3</sup> |
| COBOL     | Imperative<sup>4</sup>  |
| APL       | Declarative<sup>5</sup> |
| SNOBOL    | Imperative<sup>6</sup>  |
| BASIC     |       Imperative        |
| Algol-W   |       Imperative        |
| Jovial    |       Imperative        |
| PL/I      |       Imperative        |
| SIMULA-67 |       Imperative        | 
| Algol-68  |       Imperative        |
| Pascal    | Imperative<sup>7</sup>  |
| C         | Imperative<sup>7</sup>  |
| Prolog    | Declarative<sup>7</sup> |
| Smalltalk |       Imperative        |
| Modula-2  | Imperative<sup>8</sup>  |
| ADA       | Imperative<sup>7</sup>  |
| C++       | Imperative<sup>7</sup>  |
| Java      | Imperative<sup>7</sup>  |

## 2. A programming language may be block-structured, object-based and distributive. How is this possible?
Both block-structured and object-based programming are a part of the structured programming paradigm, and I think each structure or components of written codes are capable of running as one system.

## 3. A programming language may be logic-based, but it cannot be functional. Why so?
Logic-based programming are derived from facts and relations and compute the based on a set of provided rules whereas functional programming can rewrite rules to however you want to compute the desired data. Thus, logic-based programming cannot be functional due to how it operates although functional programming can be logic-based.

## 4. When writabilty is enhances, readability suffers. Explain.


## 5. Give some advantages of compilation over interpretation and vice versa. Considering all  these, why is compilation a preferred method of implementation over interpretation?

## 6. Interpretive programs are slower to execute than compiled programs. Explain why.

## 7. Compiled programs require more time during program development than interpretive programs. Why is this so?

## 8. How does the overall simplicity of a programming language affect its readability?

## 9. Why does too much orthogonality cause problems? Why is it considered a detrimental  effect to writability?

## 10. Java uses a right brace to mark the end of all compound statements. What are the arguments  for and against this design?

## 11. Some programming languages (e.g. Pascal) uses the semicolon to separate statements,  while Java uses it to terminate statements. Which of these, in your opinion, is most natural and least likely to result in syntax errors? Support your answer.

## 12. Many contemporary languages allow two kinds of comments: one in which delimiters are used on both ends (multiple-line comments) and one in which a delimiter marks only the beginning of the comment (one-line comments). Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of these with respect to the language evaluation criteria.
