1. Imperative Language is an explicitly defined language where computations are performed as sequences in RAM that focuses more on the teps in acquiring a result hence why it is a procedural programming paradigm. Declarative Language is an explicity defined language which focuses more on the result. It is a type of logical programming paradigm that is considered as a higher level of concept.
