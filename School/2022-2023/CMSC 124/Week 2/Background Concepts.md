# 1. What is Programming Language
- used to communicate
- in natural language, both are persons
- in programming language, computer and user
- describes computation
- communicates an instructions to a computer by a person to execute tasks
- commands formed by user executed by the computer

# 2. History of Programming Languages  
- no computers however theoritical studies exists to express computations so maths is used
- `Plankalkul` 1st documented programming language... is that true
- `Fortran` 1st successful programming language... oh? designed specifically for scientific and engineering
- ... more programming languages here but meh

# 3. Programming Language Paradigm  
### Classifications of Languages by Wegner
1.  Imperative
	- Explicit
	- Computation is performed in sequences in the RAM
	- **Types**
		1. [Block-structured](../INFO_DUMP.md#Block-Structured)
		2. [Object-based](../INFO_DUMP.md#Object-Based)
		3. [Distributed Programming](../INFO_DUMP.md#Distributed%20Programming)

2. Declarative


- pattern or modeling and solving problems
- basically the style or way of programming of how we think of problems and solve them

### Paradigms
1. Imperative
2. Declarative
3. Structured
4. Procedural
5. Functional
6. Function-level
7. Object-oriented
8. Event-driven
9. Flow-driven
10. Logic
11. Constraint
12. Aspect-oriented
13. Reflective
14. Array

Note that programs can have multiple paradigms.
