# Block-Structured
- Procedure is the principal building block of the program
- State of computation is represented by the stack with active procedure at the top
- No restrictions on duplicate items on the stack, thus recursions are allowed

### Examples
- Alogl-60
- Algol-68
- Pascal
- C
- Fortran
- ADA

----

# Object-Based
`Object` - a group of procedure that shares a state (or data)
- All data and procedures that apply to the data are captured in a single object

### Examples
- packages of ADA
- modules of Modula
- objects of Smalltalk

----

# Distributed Programming
- Languages for loosely coupled systems ~~what does this mean?
