Software Engineering is a layered structure: 
- A quality focus
	- Process
		- Methods
			- Tools
`A Quality Focus` - bedrock that supports software engineering
- like you know, quality is important and all during development for each every step. yes?
`Process` - framework that must be established for effective delivery of software engineering technology
- foundation, cus everyone follows this framework
`Methods` - provide technical instructions for building software
`Tools` - support for the process and methods (automatic or semi-automatic)

"Software in all of its forms and across all of its application domains should be engineered"
"Software engineering is important because it enables us to build complex systems in a timely manner and with high quality"

Foundation of software engineering: **process framework**

- **Process** splits into **Activities** splits into **Actions** splits into **Tasks**
`Activity` - strives to achieve broader objective and is applied across all types of application domains
`Action` - produce a major work product (composed of tasks)
`Tasks` - focuses on small but well-defined objective

Note that *process* is not a rigid prescription for building computer software but instead an adaptable approach that enables the people doing the work to pick and choose the approriate set of work actions and tasks


# The Process Framework
`Communication` -> `Planning` -> `Modelling` -> `Construction` -> `Deployment`

- `Communication`
	- gather requirements and understand stakeholder objectives
- `Planning`
	- creation of software project plan that defines the sotware engineering work
	- software projects is a complicated journey, and the planning activity creates a "map" (software project plan)
- `Modelling`
	- create model to better understand software requirements and design
	- like a sketch
- `Construction`
	- combines code generation and testing
	- start building your designs
- `Deployment`
	- deliver to the customers 
	- is complete or partially completed 

# Process Flows
- `Linear Process Flow` - executed in a sequence
- `Iterative Process Flow` - repeats one or more activities before proceeding to the next
- `Evolutionary Process Flow` - executes activities in a circular manner
- `Parallel Process Flow` - executes one or more activities in parallel with other activities
