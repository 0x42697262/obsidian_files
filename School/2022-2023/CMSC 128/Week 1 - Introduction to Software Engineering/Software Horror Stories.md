# unorganized notes
- Poor software engineering practice is the culprit (software design errors and software specifications)
- Ariane 5 Flight 501 a continuation of a costly incomplete testing procedure
- Computer Based Systems (CBS)
	- Computing System (CS)

**SpECS (System Engineering for Computer Systems)**
- Phases
	1. Capture of initial requirements
	2. System design
	3. System dimensioning

**Some major benefits**
- SpECS benefit in application is design reusability
- Getting rid of these 3 issues:
	- specifications of some modules are missing, or are ambiguous, or are incomplete
	- verification is done via testing, within some limited time budget, which means that verification is almost incomplete
	- verfication that the set of concatenated modules "behaves correctly" is a combinatorial problem



# Exercise?
- **What were the software issues experienced? When were these issues experienced?** 
- **What was the cause of these issues?**  
- **Where do you think these errors were introduced?**  
- **What could have been done to eliminate the errors mentioned?**  
- **What is the role of software engineering practice in this case?**
