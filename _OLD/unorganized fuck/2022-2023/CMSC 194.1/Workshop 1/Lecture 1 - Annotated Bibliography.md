## Purpose of annotated bibliography
- `Review` literature on a particular topic
- `Demonstrate` quality and depth of reading
- `Show` the sources that are available
- `Highlight` sources tha tmay be of interest to others
- `Organise` sources for further research


- **Has 4 parts**

### Example
```
Trevor, CO, Lansford, B & Black, JW 2004, ‘Employee turnover and job performance:
monitoring the influences of salary growth and promotion’, Journal of Armchair Psychology,
vol. 113, no.1, pp. 56-64.

In this article Trevor et al. review the influences of pay and job opportunities in respect to job
performance, turnover rates and employee motivation. The authors use data gained through
organisational surveys of blue-chip companies in Vancouver, Canada to try to identify the main
causes of employee turnover and whether it is linked to salary growth. Their research focuses
on assessing a range of pay structures such as pay for performance and organisational
reward schemes.

The article is useful to my research topic, as Trevor et al. suggest that there are numerous
reasons for employee turnover and variances in employee motivation and performance. The
main limitation of the article is that the survey sample was restricted to mid-level management,
thus the authors indicate that further, more extensive, research needs to be undertaken to
develop a more in-depth understanding of employee turnover and job performance.

This article will not form the basis of my research; however it will be useful supplementary
information for my research on pay structures.
