# Ethical Theories
## Deontological
### Duty-Based Ethics
This theory stresses that fidelity to principle and duty are the most important. The consequences of an action, according to Kant do not matter.
- based on the tradition of Locke and Hobbes

- **Basic Duties** listed by W.D. Ross
	1. Tell the truth. 
	2.  Right the wrongs that one has done to others. 
	3.  Act justly. 
	4.  Help other in respect to virtue, intelligence, and happiness. 
	5.  Improve oneself with respect to virtue and intelligence. 
	6.  Give thanks. 
	7.  Avoid injury to others.

### Rights-Based Ethics
This theory is based on upholding an individual's human or legal rights, such as the rights to privacy and ownership of property.

In the philosophical arena, rights are split up two:
- **Positive Rights**
	- "are those that give one what is needed to freely pursue his or her interests"	
	- right to health care, education and other similar things
	- "positive" in the sense that they claim for each person the positive assistance of others in fulfilling basic constituents of human well-being like health and education
	
- **Negative Rights**
	- freedom from outside interference in certain activities which are defined by the social norm of the moment
	- rights are a claim by one person that imposes a "negative" duty on all others— the duty not to interfere with a person's activities in a certain area
	- freedom of speech, the right to liberty, and privacy
	- rights that protect some form of human freedom or liberty
