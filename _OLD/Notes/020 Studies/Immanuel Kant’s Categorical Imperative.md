# Immanuel Kantâ€™s Categorical Imperative
**Morality** for Kant acting in accordance with the categorical [[Imperatives in Ethics|imperative]].
Categorical imperative is expressed in absolute command
- `Do not lie.`
- pretty much the 10 commandments

**Core Concepts of Kantian Ethics**
1. [[#The Good Will|Good Will]]
2. [[#Duty]]
3. [[#Moral Worth of an Act]]
4. [[#Formulations of Categorical Imperative]]

##### The Good Will
- good will facilitates a human act or from within the person
- good will is good by `virtue of its intrinsict value`
	- so good will is good without qualification or condition
	- must be done for the sake of duty
	- so if you expect something in return then it is not done for the sake of duty
- the act must not be forced and influenced by outside/external factors

##### Duty
- for act to be moral: it must be for the sake of duty
	- immoral: self-inclination or self-interest

##### Moral Worth of an Act
- if "in accordance with duty", then it is not a moral act but also not an immoral act
- `for the sake of duty` > `accord with duty` (has more moral act)

##### Formulations of Categorical Imperative
i think these two are important (as kant's idea's? who knows):
1. Principle of Universality
2. Principle of Humanity

**Principle of Universality**
>"act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law"

If a proposed action is adopted by everyone, then it can be considered as a universal act. It is a basis for morality principle. It has been criticized that this principle is too strict.

**Principle of Humanity**
>"act as to treat humanity whether in your own person or in that of another never as means but always as an end"

also known as "formula of the end"
Humans have values then by treating them as tools rather than an end, the person woud be reduced to the level of an animal according to Kant.
