# Static Interconnection Networks
Have direct fixed physical interconnections between processors


 Static interconnection networks have a fixed and predetermined connectivity pattern. The connections between nodes in the network are established during the system's design or configuration phase and remain unchanged during operation. Examples of static interconnection networks include mesh networks, torus networks, hypercube networks, and fat-tree networks. The connectivity of the nodes in these networks is defined by the network topology, and the routing algorithms are typically deterministic and fixed.
