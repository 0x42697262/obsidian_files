# Buffering
- a technique to temporarily store data in a buffer or memory location
- useful for transfering data on different devices with different speeds
	- when a data is transfered on the buffer, the faster device does not need to wait for the slower device 

## Types of Buffering 
1. [[Single Buffering]]
2. [[Double Buffering]]
3. [[Circular Buffering]]
