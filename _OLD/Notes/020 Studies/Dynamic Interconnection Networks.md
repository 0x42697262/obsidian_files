# Dynamic Interconnection Networks
Connection between two specific processors may be present at times and absent some other times


Dynamic interconnection networks, also known as reconfigurable interconnection networks, offer flexibility in their connectivity and can be reconfigured during runtime. The connections between nodes can be dynamically established, modified, or removed to adapt to changing communication patterns, load balancing requirements, or fault tolerance needs. Dynamic interconnection networks provide the ability to dynamically rewire the network topology based on the system's current needs. This reconfiguration can be performed at the level of individual links, switches, or even entire network segments. Dynamic interconnection networks enable efficient utilization of resources and improved performance in systems with varying communication requirements.
