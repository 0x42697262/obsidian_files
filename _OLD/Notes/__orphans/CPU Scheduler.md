# CPU Scheduler
`CPU Scheduling` basis of [[Multiprogramming|multiprogrammed]] operating systems

- decides which process gets the CPU next after a process is through with its share
- allocate the CPU to optimize system performance without sacrificing user convenience

# Basic Concepts
System with single core CPU = only **one process** can run at a time
A [[Processes|process]] is executed until it must wait. In a simple computer system, the CPU then just sits idle which is a waste with no useful work accomplished.
