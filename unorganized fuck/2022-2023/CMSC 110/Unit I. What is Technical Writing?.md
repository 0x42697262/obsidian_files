# What is "Technical Writing"?
<details>
	 <summary>Own Thoughts</summary>
	 Technical writing is like an instruction manual making everything easier to understand. Anyone can write anything about something and it can already be called technical writing. i think... But the definition for techinical writing these days is different since it's much broader and it's not only limited to making manuals thus there is no clear definition for technical writing.

# Some History
- Scientists/Engineers were the one documenting their inventions.
- Inventors focused on inventing, technical writers focused on... writing.

Technical Writing has already existed even way back in the past that has been recorded and before world war 1 scientists and engineers were the ones writing technical details for their inventions that sparked a job listing for tech writers because of a booming(?) industry until america got depressed which resulted to loss of jobs including tech writers. But after that technical writerrs became a professional job. huh, how?

There is a need for technical writers... why? i don't know. altho tech writers are not acknowledge and of course that is bad because decent writers that allows monkee brains understand something is important. Anyone can of course write a documentation but not everyone can explain it simple enough for everyone to understand. Proof: this obsidian note. 

Tech writing is not only limited to texts, it can be anything from visual graphs, to presentations, and, but not limited to, videos since certain amount of people hates reading. i am one of them.

# Process vs Product
- There is no final product in technical writing so it will always be a process until the document is "good enough"



##  Basic Concepts of Technical Writing
- Writer-centred
