# Defining Literature
*swiiish

----
# from audio recording
- history relies on "imagination"??
- literature is a form of entertainment, i think
- defamiliarization of reality
- *assume memory notes exists at this point, good luck me*

# Some words i do not know
- *garay* `verses`
- *harito* `shaman's prayers`
- *tigmo* `riddles` ~~i think i know this?
- *panultihon* `proverbs` ~~i know but i just put it
- *sugilambong* `novel`

erm the person who described this words was `Francisco Alzina` in `1668` ~~just 1 more year pls~~

TIL, generic form of poetry is `balak`, a characterization of the presence of an enigma/methapor `balaybay`/`sambingay` ~~wtf are these 2 words??

# Random understandings?
- after ww2, only *Bisaya* survived as "literacy outlet" cus of english and tagalog
- iirc, drama ain't that strong unlike poetry
- there's also that "which goes first, poetry or drama" but prof says "poetry" so it must be it
