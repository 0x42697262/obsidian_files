# Case 1: Project Management at Global Green Books Publishing
## **a) Why did Global Green Books Publishing struggle?**
The owners Jim and Brad did not have a decent project management solution to their company. The owners were not able to any software for the employees to use in scheduling and time management, and never used any tools or techniques for budgeting, communicating, and estimating with the stakeholders. Knowing all these issues, Global Green Books did not have any processes in place to manage risks and quality. These issues has lead to the following problems:
- Experiencing sudden rapid growth in business
- lacking in formal project management approach
- poor estimations, quality issues, and late deliveries
- which lead to having problems with cost control
## **b) What were the specific PM solutions that were introduced by Samantha that worked?**
Samantha has offered the following:
- Introduced a formal project management process
- Created a PM manual
- trained the employees to be decent at work
- suggested proactive risk management
- improved the communication with the stakeholders
## **c) What kind of suggestions would you give to Brad and Jim if you were the PM?**
If I were the project manager, I would suggest investing in project management tools, defining clear roles and responsibilities, customer feedback, and budget management.
## **d) Are you aware of other similar start-up businesses that struggle in a similar manner?How did they overcome the challenges?**
Yes, I am pretty much aware that similar start-up business struggle as they grow. A business' success is dependent on their project management and if the business is capable of overcoming it. Similar to what Samantha had did, I would overcome the challenges by doing these:
- introduce project management practices and tools to ensure efficient project execution and resource management
- provide training for employees
- establish quality control process
- listen to customer feedback and adapt products or services based on their needs
- implement sound financial management practices to control costs and maintain profitability
## **e) Global Green Books Publishing is a technology intensive business, but Samantha is not technically knowledgeable, will she continue to be a successful project manager?**
Samantha's success as a project manager in a technology-intensive business is attributed to her project management skills, including communication, interpersonal skills, attention to detail, and her ability to implement structured processes. Her main focus is to manage a project, which involves planning, organizing, executing, and controlling projects to achieve specific goals. She only needs people who got the skills and technicalities or people that are specialist in the field to handle the project well. Her success depends on her ability to coordinate and manage project activities, facilitate communication, mitigate risks, and deliver projects on time and within budget. Thus, I believe that Samantha as the project manager is a capable person that will be successful in the company.
