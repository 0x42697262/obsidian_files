# Period and Frequency

---

**Period** refers to the amount of time, in seconds; a signal needs to complete 1 cycle. **Frequency** refers to the number of periods in 1 second.

## Formula

### Frequency

$$f=\frac{1}{T}$$
_Frequency is formally expressed in [[Herts|Hertz]] (Hz), which is cycles per second._

### Period

$$T=\frac{1}{F}$$

_Period is formally expressed in seconds._

Frequency has two extremes (physically impossible):

- If a signal does _not change_ at all, it never completes a cycle, its frequency is _zero_.
- If a signal _changes instantaneously_, its frequency is _infinite_ (unbounded) and its period is _zero_.

- frequency is the rate of change with respect to time
  - change in a short span of time means high frequency
  - change over a long span of time means low frequency
