# Periodic Analog Signals

---

Periodic analog signals can be classified as _simple_ or _composite_.

- A **simple** periodic analog signal, a sine wave, cannot be decomposed into simpler signals.
- A **composite** periodic analog signal is composed of multiple sine waves

The [[SineWave|sine wave]] is the most fundamental form of a periodic analog signal.
