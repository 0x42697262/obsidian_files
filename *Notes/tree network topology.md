```
Tree Topology is a network structure where multiple devices, like computers or servers, are connected in a hierarchical or tree-like fashion. In this setup, there is a central node (often called the "root") that connects to other nodes, forming branches. Each branch can further split into more branches, creating a tree structure. This helps in organizing and managing the network efficiently.

**Tree Topology**, also known as _Hierarchical Topology_ or *star-bus topology*, is a type of network topology used in data communications and networking. It is designed to combine the benefits of both _star_ and _bus_ topologies while minimizing their drawbacks. The network is structured like a tree, with a central node acting as the root of the tree. This _central node_ is often a high-capacity network device, such as a hub or a switch. Connected to this root node are multiple secondary nodes, which can be switches, routers, or other networking devices. These secondary nodes can be seen as branches emanating from the root.

## Regular tree networks

A regular tree network's topology is characterized by two parameters: the branching, $d$, and the number of generations, $G$ . The total number of the nodes, $N$ , and the number of peripheral nodes $N_p$ , are given by:

$$
N = \frac{d^{G+1}-1}{d-1}, N_p = d^G
$$
