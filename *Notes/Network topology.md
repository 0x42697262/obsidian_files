# Network topology

---

Network Topology is the geometric representation of the relationship of all links and linking devices (nodes) to one another.

**Categories**:

1. `Physical Topology`: refers to the actual physical connections of how the network is arranged
2. `Logical Topology`: refers to the higher-level idea of how the network is arranged

**Types**:

1. [[NetworkTopology.MeshTopology|Mesh Topology]] (Basic)
2. [[NetworkTopology.StarTopology|Star Topology]] (Basic)
3. [[Bus network topology|Bus Topology]] (Basic)
4. [[NetworkTopology.RingTopology|Ring Topology]] (Basic)
5. [[NetworkTopology.LineTopology|Line Topology]]
6. [[NetworkTopology.PointToPointTopology|Point-to-Point Topology]]
7. [[NetworkTopology.TreeTopology|Tree Topology]]
8. [[NetworkTopology.HybridTopology|Hybrid Topology]]
