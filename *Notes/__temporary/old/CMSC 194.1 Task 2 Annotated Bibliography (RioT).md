Yoshida, T., Fukao, T., & Hasegawa, T. (2019). A tomato recognition method for harvesting with robots using point clouds. *2019 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)*. https\://doi.org/10.1109/sii.2019.8700358

In this article, Yoshida, Fukao, and Hasegawa proposes a method to detect the peduncles of tomatoes for a harvesting robot using point clouds. Penducle detection uses a 3D point cloud taken by a RGBD camera equipped on to the harvesting robot. The main objective of this study is to develop automated harvesting methods for harvesting robots that can work as temporary workers for busy times. An energy function was defined based on one condition and was minimized to identify appropriate cutting points based on the voxels including peduncles and stems.

The authors focused the study on implementing a harvesting robot where its tasked to identify the cutting points of target tomate peduncles to harvest the target tomates on a real farm. Images are taken through voxelization with two resolutions and is then parsed into classifications of tomato regions. Which are then calculated to estimate the maturity of the tomato segments to be identified as the cutting point of the harvesting robot. Although this study is a bit interesting, it can be helpful for larger real farms that needs more workers or manpower in harvesting tomatoes. This study potentially be further developed to harvest other fruits and vegetables as well.

This article however does not conform to my research study but it might be helpful in training artificial intelligence for detecting objects and recognizing patterns.

In this study, Khan *et al.* developed a multi-license plate recognition using Faster-Region-based Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm (Faster R-CNN) that can recognize multiple license plates in one image at varying weather and illumination. Faster R-CNN is used for detecting multiple vehicles in one image resulting to a scaled information in locating the license plates; Morphological operations are employed to reduce non-plate regions and geometric properties are used to localize plates in HSI color space. Adaptive boosting with modified census transform for character recognition. 

This study may be useful for my research topic as Khan *et al.* proposed a significantly better conventional approaches in terms of precision and and recall for multiple plate recognition. The main limitation of this study is that the dataset the researchers have used came from data centers that provide the plate numbers, it would be helpful if the researchers have included images taken from smart phones.

This is an interesting article and might be of use to my research topic although I do not think it would be helpful, but I can use this study to further expand my review of literature.

In this article, Weißhuhn and Hoberg studies the benefits and operational design of VMI relationships between manufacturers and consumers in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment. Smart Replenishment is modelled as an inventory system with a single manufacturer and consumers characterized by Poisson-distributed demand for a single product; This serves as a proposal of mixed Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) and Non-VMI. The have shown that the cost-reducing and revenue-inducing potential of Smart Replenishment for a single product can be huge depending on different demand and supply characteristics.

The authors did a good job of examining the use of IoT for VMI at the end consumer. However, it would have been beneficial to explore the potential challenges associated with implementing such a system, such as data security and privacy concerns, as well as the need for standardization across different vendors. Additionally, the paper fails to discuss the potential impacts of this technology on the environment\, such as the need for the production and disposal of additional connected devices, and the potential increase in energy consumption. Finally, the paper could have included an analysis of the customer experience, such as the pros and cons of using such a system, and how it could improve or detract from their satisfaction.

This study focuses on IoT devices that is within my broad topic for my research study although this article does not contain the necessary details and literature, as such it would not provide much assistance.
