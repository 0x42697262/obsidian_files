Atibula II and Roxas proposes deep learning as a tool for automatically identifying phytoplanktons taxonomy classification by using Inception V3 model as the traditional routine analysis is time consuming, expensive, and requires an expertise. The model classifies an image by analyzing and provide its score to the predicted classes and about two hundred (200) images will be provided for each category. The result shows that out of 2000 images, only 1915 are correctly classified and 85 are inapproriately categorized. This implies that the method is comparable or better than existing systems.

The authors of this study have only mentioned acquiring the data set from Woods Hole Open Access Server, but the authors did not provide any artifact of the data set in their paper that can aid the readers on what the data set might look like. There is a sample classification image that is provided by the authors although it appears that there is no need for the authors to include that image without further emphasis, they should include more information about the figure they are providing.

This journal article is not related to my research, however this gave me insight that there is an option to train a model without having to acquire huge amount of resources.

Quiroz Jr., F. E. & Roxas, R. R. (2019). Comparison of common part-of-speech tagging techniques applied to waray-waray text. *International Symposium on Innovation in Information Technology and Application*.

Quiroz Jr. and Roxas compares common part-of-speech tagging techniques to waray-waray language using four tagging algorithms: N-gram, Trigrams 'n' Tags, Naïve Bayes, and Brill taggers. Each statistical models will be tested to compare the results of the tagged sets, which will be taken from a collection of religious and literature texts. With the different results, TnT has better accuracy in comparison with the other tagging techniques promising as the best tagger for Waray-waray language.

The authors uses four different tagging algorithms for the language however there are no statements regarding why the commonly used PoS tagging systems are being used. The authors mentions that the four taggers are relatively close to each other in their conclusion and provides future researchers to explore and tweak the parameters for better efficiency without stating on what tweaks can be used.

This study examines different commonly used tagging algorithms, however this study is not relevant to my research on the comparison of different PoS tagging techniques. This study's focus is different from my research. It may be useful for NLP researchers but I am looking for articles relating to vulnerability research in computing systems.

Ygnacio, M. A. V., & Roxas, R. R. (2017). A system that converts music score sheets with round notes into one with shape notes. *Theory and Practice of Computation*, 229–238. https\://doi.org/10.1142/9789813202818_0018

Ygnacio and Roxas presents a system that is capable of converting music score sheets with round notes into varied shape objects like squares, triangles, diamonds, etc that aids music amateurs and enthusiasts. The authors propose a method that combines various music notation tools into one system with desired result such as an encoding algorithm that takes input from an image and an algorithm that reads the output of the encoder. The results shows that the designed software system is capable of transcripting musical score notations into different shapes or symbols although with few issues such as incorrectly identifying a note and its limitations.

It would be interesting to know more details about the process such its dataset used and the size used by the authors, the percentage of correct conversions, a comparison to other methods. Thus, giving more insight into the reliability and effectiveness of the software system.

This paper presents an interesting solution but it is not related to my current study. Although it is not directly related to my study, it provides a unique perspective on the field and may have potential applications or insights that can be applied to my study in the future.
