In this article, Cahutay and Vicente proposes an analysis of Tumblr users' online behavior in determining whether the users are depressed based on the contents posted. Data will be collected through a hashtag content from the users' posts which then will be sent with an invitation to take a survey. CN2 rule induction algorithm is implemented in analyzing the collected data which are referenced to Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) Scale and Primary Health Questionnaire - 2 (PHQ-2) to validate the results. The authors have found out that Tumblr user contents correlates with depression and it is oriented towards photo contents rather than pure textual posts.

The authors of this study implies the analysis of depressed users on Tumblr based on their contents by following the content hashtag and used an algorithm to validate the results of the collected data. However, the authors did not provide adequate explainations and details in analyzing the collected data and did not provide a detailed discussion of how the machine learning algorithm is being implemented.

This article however does not conform to my study since it did not present the use of machine learning to which I need for my research.

Varona, M. C. & Vicente, A. J., Fake news identification using article-to-article stance detection. *Department of Computer Science*, University of the Philippines Cebu. 

In this study, Varona and Vicente introduces a novel approach for detecting fake news articles from various website domains using stance detection with a UCL machine reading model. The proliferation of fake news has become a major concern in recent years, and this method aims to provide a solution for combating its rapid circulation. The inter-article stance detection process results in an accuracy rate of 80% for correctly identifying fake news articles and 90% for identifying legitimate news articles, with the overall accuracy results of of 85%.

While it is commendable that the dataset for this study was taken from an open-source repository, the use of only one potentially untrusted source checker raises concerns about the reliability of the results. It would be more convincing if multiple source checkers were used to verify the authenticity of the news articles. The authors heavily relies on fact checking that it would be certainly be possible to flag a fake news article as legitimate one because the machine learning algorithm only relies on the dataset of inputs. It is recommended to further verify the data through crawling various information not only limited to news articles but also proven facts that supports the arguments.

This article does not conform to my study since it is completely unrelated to my field of study.

Tan, E. E., & Vicente, A. J. (2019). Fire spread prediction using probabilistic cellular automata: the case of urban settlements in the philippines. The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, XLII–4/W19, 415–420. https\://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w19-415-2019

In this study, Tan and Vicente presents a method for predicting the spread of fires in urban settlements in the Philippines using probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) by developing a PCA model based on data from past fires in the region and use it to simulate the spread of fires under various conditions. The authors also compare the performance of their PCA model to that of a traditional fire spread model based on differential equations. The results show that the PCA model is able to accurately predict the spread of fires in the region and has the added advantage of being computationally efficient. 

The authors have shown a map that fires would potentially spread in a typical format for maps which is then converted into a cell. For easier approach, the authors should instead rotate the map and apply polygon to cell conversion. Other than improving the platform such as including digitalized buildings and processing speed, the authors or other researchers can include more varied variables such as trees, walls, climate, or weather temperature.


This paper is not for my field of study and does not serve any benefit or purpose, however I find the subject to be interesting.
