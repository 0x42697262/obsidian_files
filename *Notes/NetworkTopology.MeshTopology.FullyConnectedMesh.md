# Fully Connected Mesh

---

Every node (devices) has a *direct connection* to every other node.

- This design offers the highest level of fault tolerance because when one connection fails, there are alternative paths for data to reach its destination.
- Physical links: `n(n-1)`
- Duplex mode: `n(n-1)/2`

**Advantages**:

1. Eliminates traffic problems
2. Robust
3. Privacy or Security
4. Easy fault identification and fault isolation

**Disadvantages**:

1. High amount of cabling and I/O ports
2. Difficult installation and reconnection
3. Bulk of wiring limit space
4. Expensive hardware (I/O ports and cables)
