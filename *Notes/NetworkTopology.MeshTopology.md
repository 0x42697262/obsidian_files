# Mesh Topology

---

```
In this setup, every device is directly connected to every other device. Imagine a web where each device is a point, and there are lines connecting each point to every other point. This ensures that if one connection fails, there's always another path for data to travel. It's like having multiple roads to reach your destination in case one is blocked.
```

Mesh Topology is a network architecture characterized by a fully interconnected arrangement of devices. _Every node (device) is connected to every other node_ resulting in a high degree of redundancy and fault tolerance.

**Types**:

1. [[NetworkTopology.MeshTopology.FullyConnectedMesh|Fully Connected Mesh]]
2. [[NetworkTopology.PartiallyConnectedMesh|Partially Connected Mesh]]
