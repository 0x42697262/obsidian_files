- clustering




- show learning curve
research questions:
- can we categorize the beatmaps based on learning curve
- how many replays can someone achieve full combo
	- survival analysis (Geometric Distribution)

1st stage: determine labels, group rank (classify)
2nd: classify if belongs to a rank -> give survival model -> how many replays achievable

**how many replays can players achieves certain score**

replays:
- success (complete)
- fail

movement cursor and tapping



- not trained on single player



- look progress certain players
- ctagorize beatmaps difficulty

stratified sampling
