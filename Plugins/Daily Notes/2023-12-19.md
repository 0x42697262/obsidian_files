Lessons for today:
1. If you clone a repository with submodules, make sure to clone recursively. Do `--recurse-submodules` and add `-j8` for cloning 8 submodules at the same time.

[[Naive Bayes]]
- independence
- conditional independence

independence:
$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$, check

conditional independence:
$P(A \cap B | C) = P(A | C) \times P(B | C); P(C) > 0$
