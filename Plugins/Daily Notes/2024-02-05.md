[[Single-Layer Network]] 1st phase of [[Artificial Neural Network]]

## Basic Principles of ANN Design:

1. all or nothing (binary)
2. will activate on at least one neuron
3.
4. runs in parallel
5.

## [[Hebbian Learning]]

- "neurons that fire together, wire together"
- not used much in [[Deep Learning]] because of [[Backpropagation]]

### [[Perceptron]]

- uses [[Signum Function]] as its activation function
- binary classifier
- $f: x \rightarrow y$ where $\in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{p}$ and $y \in {-1 ,1}$ 
- $\hat f$ can be defined as: $\hat f(x) = \sigma(w \times x + b)$ because there is no guarantee that the perceptron can perfectly learn $f$
  $w$ is a vector of learnable parameters
  $\sigma$
  $b$ is bias

- weight learning initialization difference between randomized and zero: convergence

it's stupid how i missed adding `hardware.enableAllFirmware` in the configuration. do this if it's needed for other devices like wireless chips.

# [[Memory Safety Vulnerabilities]]

## [[Buffer Overflow]]

- takes advantage of automatic [[Bounds Checking]]
- writes more data to the buffer than its allocation, thus overflowing it
- type of attacks:
	- [[Stack Smashing]]

### [[Stack Smashing]]

- intentionally overflowing the buffer on the [[Call Stack]] to **overwrite** the function return address

### [[Format String Vulnerability]]

- manipulates the format strings in functions with user input data without proper validation
- *If your program has a format string vulnerability, assume that the attacker can learn any value stored in memory and can take **control of your program***. i wonder how format string vulnerability takes control of a program. i think through the use of `%n` in C

### [[Integer Conversion Vulnerabilities]]

- basically [[Integer Overflow]] and [[Integer Underflow]]??


### [[Off-By-One Vulnerabilities ]]

- programming issue
- occurs not only in array indexing, string functions, iterations, etc

### [[Dangling Pointer]]

- pointer into a memory region has been freed and is no longer available

### [[Double Free Vulnerability]]

- allocated memory is freed multiple times

### [[Use After Free Vulnerability]]

- object or structure in memory is deallocated or freed but still used

### [[Heap Overflow]]
