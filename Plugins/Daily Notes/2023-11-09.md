# Instructions:
1. Create an overview of the problem being solved, e.g., what was the story behind the collection of the data, description of the attributes/features used,etc.
2. (Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis) Present descriptive statistics as applicable (e.g., distribution, central tendency, variability) of the data before training the models. Clean the data if there are missing values, etc. You may perform feature engineering (i.e., creating new features out of the given features), but be sure to document your justifications. 
3. Split your data into proportions of 70% training set and 30% testing set.
4. Train the following models: (a) logistic regression classifier and (b) naive Bayes classifier on the dataset.
5. Evaluate the performance of the trained model. You may use additional performance measures if you want, but for now I will only require the calculation of the accuracy. The accuracy measures the fraction of correct classifications. With this, you need to generate the confusion matrix. You may read this if you haven't encountered this concept before: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/confusion-matrix#:~:text=A%20confusion%20matrix%20represents%20the,by%20model%20as%20other%20class. Remember to compute this matrix from the test set (not the training set).

Socket programming is a fundamental concept in networking that allows applications on different devices to communicate with each other over a network. It provides a way for processes (applications) to create, send, and receive data over a network, whether it's a local network or the internet. Here's an overview of how socket programming works: 

1. Socket Creation: The first step is to create a socket, which is an endpoint for sending or receiving data. In most programming languages, including Python, you can use libraries like the socket module to create sockets.

2. Binding: If you're creating a server, you typically need to bind the socket to a specific IP address and port. This allows the server to listen for incoming connections on that address and port. Clients, on the other hand, don't usually need to bind.

 3. Listening (for Servers): Servers, after binding, will start listening for incoming connections. They wait for clients to establish connections.

 4. Connection Establishment (for Clients): Clients create a socket and then connect to a specific server's IP address and port. This is how they establish a connection with the server.

 5. Data Transfer: Once a connection is established, both the server and client can send and receive data. Data is sent and received as streams of bytes.

 6. Closing the Connection: When the communication is complete, either the server or the client can initiate the closing of the connection. This allows the resources associated with the socket to be released.

 

Socket programming is typically used in two communication paradigms:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP sockets provide a reliable, connection-oriented communication channel. Data sent over a TCP socket is guaranteed to be delivered in the correct order and without loss. It's ideal for applications that require reliability, such as web browsing, email, and file transfer.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): UDP sockets are connectionless and provide a lightweight, best-effort communication channel. While they are faster, they don't guarantee reliable delivery. UDP is used in scenarios where a small amount of data can be lost without significant impact, such as real-time video streaming, online gaming, and DNS.

In socket programming, servers listen on well-known ports (e.g., HTTP servers on port 80, FTP servers on port 21) to provide specific services. Clients connect to these ports to request services.
