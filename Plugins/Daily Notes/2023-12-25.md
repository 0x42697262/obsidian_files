starting monitor mode: `airmon-ng start <interface>`
checking if monitor mode: `iwconfig` and find the `Mode:Monitor`
use `airodump-ng <interface>`  to see all the access points

make sure to `airmon-ng check kill`

### for sniffing the network

`airodump-ng --bssid <ap_bssid> --essid <ap_name> -c <channel> -w <filename> <interface>`

> [!NOTE]- This is wrong
> if your card can't capture the data, it will only show `clear-to-send` and `request-to-send` and no `Acknowledgement`. a successful sniff must have both `Acknowledgement` and `WPA Handshake` in [[airodump-ng]]
it needs CTS -> RTS -> Qos Data

targeting a specific network requires specifying the [[BSSID]]. 


or an alternative to that above would be:
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
iwconfig

```
wlan.fc.type_subtype in {0x00}
```

# iw

`iw dev` show which interface it is related to `phy`

## find if it supports AP

`$ iw list`
```
Wiphy phy1
	Supported interface modes:
		 * IBSS
		 * managed
